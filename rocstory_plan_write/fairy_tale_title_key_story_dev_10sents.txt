The prohibition of wine hindered many of the Prophet ' s contemporaries from embracing his religion . </s> It is said that the famous poet El-Aasha ,  who was one of them ,  delayed to join his cause on this account ,  until death prevented him . </s> A person passing by his tomb  ( at Menfooah ,  in El-Yemameh )  ,  and observing that it was moist ,  asked the reason ,  and was answered ,  that the young men of the place ,  considering him still as their cup-companion ,  drank wine over his grave ,  and poured his cup upon it . </s> Yet many of the most respectable of the pagan Arabs ,  like certain of the Jews and early Christians ,  abstained totally from wine ,  from a feeling of its injurious effects upon morals ,  and ,  in their climate ,  upon health ;  or ,  more especially ,  from the fear of being led by it into the commission of foolish and degrading actions . </s> Thus ,  eys the son of  ' Aim ,  being one night overcome with wine ,  attempted to grasp the moon ,  and swore that he would not quit the spot where he stood until he had laid hold of it :  after leaping several times with the view of doing so ,  he fell flat upon his face ;  and when he recovered his senses ,  and was acquainted with the cause of his face being bruised ,  he made a solemn vow to abstain from wine ever after . </s> A similar feeling operated upon many Muslims more than religious principle . </s> The Khaleefeh  ' Abd-El-Melik Ibn-Marwan took pleasure in the company of a slave named Naeeb ,  and one day desired him to drink with him .

Alas ,  that this poor creature should not have died but in this manner by our hands !  -- Wherefore this idling ?  exclaimed the woman . </s> -- And what can I do ?  asked her husband .

And he drew near to the table ,  and put forth his left hand ,  and thus ate with me :  so I was surprised at him ;  and when we had finished he washed his hand ,  and I gave him a napkin with which to wipe it . </s> We then sat down to converse ,  and I said ,  O my master dispel a trouble from my mind . </s> Wherefore didst thou eat with thy left hand ?  Probably something paineth thee in thy right hand ?  -- On hearing these words ,  he stretched forth his arm from his sleeve ,  and behold ,  it was maimed -- an arm without a hand !  And I wondered at this ;  but he said to me ,  Wonder not ;  nor say in thy heart that I ate with thee with my left hand from a motive of self-conceit ;  for rather to be wondered at is the cause of the cutting off of my right hand . </s> And what ,  said I ,  was the cause of it ?  He answered ,  thus :  --  Know that I am from Baghdad :  my father was one of the chief people of that city ;  and when I had attained the age of manhood ,  I heard the wanderers and travellers and merchants conversing respecting the land of Egypt ,  and their words remained in my heart until my father died ,  when I took large sums of money ,  and prepared merchandise consisting of the stuffs of Baghdad and of El-Moil ,  and similar precious goods ,  and ,  having packed them up ,  journeyed from Baghdad ;  and God decreed me safety until I entered this your city . </s> And so saying ,  he wept ,  and repeated these verses :  --    The blear-eyed escapeth a pit into which the clear-sighted falleth ;    And the ignorant ,  an expression by which the shrewd sage is ruined . </s> The believer can scarce earn his food ,  while the impious infidel     is favoured . </s> What art or act can a man devise ?

The broker answered ,  The price bidden for her hath amounted to ten thousand pieces of gold ,  and her owner hath sworn that this sum doth not equal the cost of the chickens which she hath eaten ,  nor the cost of the dresses which she hath bestowed upon her teachers ;  for she hath learnt writing and grammar and lexicology ,  and the interpretation of the ur-an ,  and the fundamentals of law and religion ,  and medicine ,  and the computation of the calendar ,  and the art of playing upon musical instruments .

I was in fear for my property ,  and came hither on account of it ,  and have found the gate shut ,  and now I have become in fear for my life !  -- He then returned to seek for himself a place in which to sleep until the morning :  and ,  finding a private burial-place enclosed by four walls ,  with a palm-tree within it ,  and a gate-way of hard stone ,  open ,  he entered it ,  and desired to sleep ;  but sleep came not to him . </s> Tremor and gloom overcame him ,  thus lying among the tombs ,  and he rose upon his feet ,  and ,  opening the door ,  looked out ,  and beheld a light gleaming in the distance in the direction of the city-gate . </s> He advanced a few steps ,  and saw the light approaching in the way which led to the burial-place in which he was taking refuge ;  whereupon Ghanim feared for himself ,  and hastily closed the door ,  and climbed up into the palm-tree ,  and concealed himself in the midst of its branches . </s> The light continued to approach the tomb by little and little until it came very near ;  and as he looked attentively at it ,  he perceived three black slaves ,  two of whom were bearing a chest ,  the other having in his hand an adze and a lantern ;  and as they drew near ,  one of the two slaves who were bearing the chest said ,  What aileth thee ,  O awab ?  -- to which the other of the two replied ,  What aileth thee ,  O Kafoor ?  The former rejoined ,  Were we not here at the hour of nightfall ,  and did we not leave the door open ?  -- Yes ,  answered the other :  what thou sayest is true . </s> -- See then ,  resumed the first speaker ,  it is shut and barred . </s> -- Upon this ,  the third ,  who was carrying the adze and light ,  and whose name was Bakheet ,  said ,  How small is your sense !  Know ye not that the owners of the gardens go forth from Baghdad and repair hither ,  and ,  evening overtaking them ,  enter this place ,  and shut the door upon themselves ,  through fear ,  lest the blacks ,  like ourselves ,  should take them and roast them and eat them ?  -- Thou hast spoken truth ,  they answered ;  but there is none among us of less sense than thyself . </s> -- Verily ,  he replied ,  ye will not believe me until we enter the burial-place and find some one in it :  and I imagine that ,  if any one be in it ,  and have seen the light ,  he hath betaken himself to the top of the palm-tree . </s> When Ghanim heard these words of the slave ,  he said within himself ,  How cunning is this slave !  May Allah disgrace the blacks for their malice and villainy !  There is no strength nor power but in God ,  the High ,  the Great !  What will deliver me from this difficulty ?  -- The two who were bearing the chest then said to him who had the adze ,  Climb over the wall ,  and open to us the door ,  O Bakheet ;  for we are fatigued with carrying the chest upon our necks :  and if thou open to us the door ,  we will give thee one of the persons whom we take ,  and we will fry him for thee excellently ,  so that not a drop of his fat shall be lost . </s> But he replied ,  I am afraid of a thing that my little sense hath suggested to me :  let us throw over the chest behind the door ;  for it is our deposite .

He then looked aside ,  and ,  seeing me with my turban falling from my head ,  while I still cried out and wept violently and threw dust upon my head ,  he called out to me :  so I approached him ,  and he said to me ,  Wo to thee !  O malevolent slave !  O misbegotten wretch !  O thou of accursed race !  What events hast thou brought about !  But ,  by Allah ,  I will strip off thy skin from thy flesh ,  and cut thy flesh from thy bones !  -- By Allah ,  replied I ,  thou canst not do to me anything ;  for thou boughtest me with my fault ,  on this condition ,  the witnesses testifying that thou boughtest me with my fault ,  thou knowing it ,  and it was ,  that I was accustomed to tell one lie every year ;  and this is but half a lie ,  and when the year is complete I will tell the other half of it ;  so it will be an entire lie . </s> But upon this ,  he cried out at me ,  O most accursed of slaves !  is this but half a lie ?  Nay ,  it is an exceeding calamity !  Depart from me ;  for thou art free !  -- By Allah ,  I replied ,  if thou liberate me ,  I will not liberate thee until the year be complete ,  and I tell the remaining half of the lie ;  and when I have completed it ,  then take me to the market ,  and sell me as thou boughtest me with my fault ,  and liberate me not ;  for I have no trade by means of which to procure my subsistence :  this is a legal proposition that I have stated to thee ,  laid down by the lawyers in the Chapter of Emancipation . </s> -- While we were thus talking ,  the crowd approached ,  with the people of the quarter ,  women and men ,  come to mourn ,  and the Walee with his attendants :  and my master and the other merchants went to the Walee ,  and acquainted him with the case ,  and that this was but half a lie ;  and when the people who were present heard this ,  they were astonished at this lie ,  and struck with the utmost wonder ;  and they cursed and reviled me ;  while I stood laughing ,  and saying ,  How can my master kill me when he bought me with this fault ?  So when my master went to the house ,  he found it in a state of ruin  ( and it was I who destroyed the greater part ,  and broke in it things worth a large sum of money )  ;  and his wife said to him ,  It was Kafoor who broke the vessels and the China-ware . </s> Upon this ,  his rage increased ,  and he exclaimed ,  By Allah !  in my life I have never seen such a misbegotten wretch as this slave ;  yet he calleth it half a lie !  What then would have been the result had it been a whole lie !  In that case he had destroyed a city ,  or two cities !  -- Then ,  in the excess of his rage ,  he went to the Walee ,  who inflicted upon me a severe beating ,  so that I became insensible ,  and swooned away ;  after which ,  my master contrived means of obtaining for me a high price ,  and I ceased not to excite disturbances in the places into which I was sold ,  and was transferred from Emeer to Emeer and from Grandee to Grandee ,  by sale and purchase ,  until I entered the palace of the Prince of the Faithful ,  and now my spirit is broken ,  and my strength hath failed . </s> CONTINUATION OF THE STORY OF GHANIM THE SON OF EIYOOB ,  THE DISTRACTED SLAVE OF LOVE . </s> When the other slaves had heard his story ,  they laughed at it ,  and said to him ,  Verily thou art a villain ,  the son of a villain :  thou hast told an abominable lie . </s> The first and second then said to the third slave ,  Relate to us thy story . </s> -- O sons of my uncle ,  he replied ,  all that hath just been related is nonsense :  but my story is long ,  and this is not a time to tell it ;  for the morning ,  O sons of my uncle ,  is near ,  and perhaps it may overtake us with this chest still before us ,  and we shall be disgraced among the public ,  and our lives will be lost ;  haste then to work ,  and when we have finished ,  and returned home ,  I will relate to you my story . </s> So they put down the light ,  and dug a trench of the size of the chest between four tombs ;  Kafoor digging ,  and awab removing the earth in baskets ,  until they had dug to the depth of half a fathom ,  when they put the chest into the trench ,  and replaced the earth over it ,  and went forth from the enclosure ,  and ,  having closed the gate ,  disappeared from before the eyes of Ghanim the son of Eiyoob .

I had explored every corner ,  save only the room that was shut in by the Golden Door ,  and I had no longer anything to amuse myself with . </s> I stood before the forbidden place for some time ,  gazing at its beauty ;  then a happy inspiration struck me ,  that because I unlocked the door it was not necessary that I should enter the chamber . </s> It would be enough for me to stand outside and view whatever hidden wonders might be therein . </s> Thus arguing against my own conscience ,  I turned the key ,  when a smell rushed out that ,  pleasant though it was ,  overcame me completely ,  and I fell fainting across the threshold . </s> Instead of being warned by this accident ,  directly I came to myself I went for a few moments into the air to shake of the effects of the perfume ,  and then entered boldly . </s> I found myself in a large ,  vaulted room ,  lighted by tapers ,  scented with aloes and ambergris ,  standing in golden candle-sticks ,  whilst gold and silver lamps hung from the ceiling . </s> Though objects of rare workmanship lay heaped around me ,  I paid them scant attention ,  so much was I struck by a great black horse which stood in one corner ,  the handsomest and best-shaped animal I had ever seen . </s> His saddle and bridle were of massive gold ,  curiously wrought ;  one side of his trough was filled with clean barley and sesame ,  and the other with rose water .
