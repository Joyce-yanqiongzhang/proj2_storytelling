 uncomfortable thing	#	goblins	#	forgot curdie	#	garden    heard	#	<EOL>  </s> The only uncomfortable thing was that her nurse was so nervous and particular about being in before the sun was down that often she would take to her heels when nothing worse than a fleecy cloud crossing the sun threw a shadow on the hillside ;  and many an evening they were home a full hour before the sunlight had left the weather-cock on the stables . </s> If it had not been for such odd behaviour Irene would by this time have almost forgotten the goblins . </s> She never forgot Curdie ,  but him she remembered for his own sake ,  and indeed would have remembered him if only because a princess never forgets her debts until they are paid . </s> One splendid sunshiny day ,  about an hour after noon ,  Irene ,  who was playing on a lawn in the garden ,  heard the distant blast of a bugle . </s> She jumped up with a cry of joy ,  for she knew by that particular blast that her father was on his way to see her .

 house	#	window-ledge    staring	#	turnip inside	#	garden	#	<EOL>  </s> They saw them only at night ,  while on guard about the house . </s> The testimony of the man who first reported having seen one of them was that ,  as he was walking slowly round the house ,  while yet in the shadow ,  he caught sight of a creature standing on its hind legs in the moonlight ,  with its forefeet upon a window-ledge ,  staring in at the window . </s> Its body might have been that of a dog or wolf ,  he thought ,  but he declared on his honour that its head was twice the size it ought to have been for the size of its body ,  and as round as a ball ,  while the face ,  which it turned upon him as it fled ,  was more like one carved by a boy upon the turnip inside which he is going to put a candle than anything else he could think of . </s> It rushed into the garden . </s> He sent an arrow after it ,  and thought he must have struck it ;  for it gave an unearthly howl ,  and he could not find his arrow any more than the beast ,  although he searched all about the place where it vanished .
 ale-jug	#	reported	#	man gave	#	companions	#	<EOL>  </s> They laughed at him until he was driven to hold his tongue ,  and said he must have taken too long a pull at the ale-jug . </s> But before two nights were over he had one to side with him ,  for he ,  too ,  had seen something strange ,  only quite different from that reported by the other . </s> The description the second man gave of the creature he had seen was yet more grotesque and unlikely . </s> They were both laughed at by the rest ;  but night after night another came over to their side ,  until at last there was only one left to laugh at all his companions . </s> Two nights more passed ,  and he saw nothing ;  but on the third he came rushing from the garden to the other two before the house ,  in such an agitation that they declared -- for it was their turn now -- that the band of his helmet was cracking under his chin with the rising of his hair inside it .

 small bears	#	owners	#	abnormal developments	#	definable conformation	#	<EOL>  </s> The original stocks of these horrible creatures were very much the same as the animals now seen about farms and homes in the country ,  with the exception of a few of them ,  which had been wild creatures ,  such as foxes ,  and indeed wolves and small bears ,  which the goblins ,  from their proclivity towards the animal creation ,  had caught when cubs and tamed . </s> But in the course of time all had undergone even greater changes than had passed upon their owners . </s> They had altered -- that is ,  their descendants had altered -- into such creatures as I have not attempted to describe except in the vaguest manner -- the various parts of their bodies assuming ,  in an apparently arbitrary and self-willed manner ,  the most abnormal developments . </s> Indeed ,  so little did any distinct type predominate in some of the bewildering results ,  that you could only have guessed at any known animal as the original ,  and even then ,  what likeness remained would be more one of general expression than of definable conformation . </s> But what increased the gruesomeness tenfold was that ,  from constant domestic ,  or indeed rather family association with the goblins ,  their countenances had grown in grotesque resemblance to the human .
 place clear	#	night week	#	stairs    walk	#	dreamy mood	#	<EOL>  </s> But the creatures were too cunning to be easily caught ;  nor were the watchers quick-eyed enough to descry the head ,  or the keen eyes in it ,  which ,  from the opening whence the stream issued ,  would watch them in turn ,  ready ,  the moment they should leave the lawn ,  to report the place clear . </s> That Night Week During the whole of the week Irene had been thinking every other moment of her promise to the old lady ,  although even now she could not feel quite sure that she had not been dreaming . </s> Could it really be that an old lady lived up in the top of the house ,  with pigeons and a spinning-wheel ,  and a lamp that never went out ?   She was ,  however ,  none the less determined ,  on the coming Friday ,  to ascend the three stairs ,  walk through the passages with the many doors ,  and try to find the tower in which she had either seen or dreamed her grandmother . </s> Her nurse could not help wondering what had come to the child -- she would sit so thoughtfully silent ,  and even in the midst of a game with her would so suddenly fall into a dreamy mood . </s> But Irene took care to betray nothing ,  whatever efforts Lootie might make to get at her thoughts .
