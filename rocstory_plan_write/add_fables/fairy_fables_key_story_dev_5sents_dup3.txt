This is a question which cannot be answered in a few words . </s> The prohibition of wine ,  or ,  rather ,  of fermented and intoxicating liquors ,  being one of the most remarkable and important points of the Mohammadan religion ,  it might be imagined that the frequent stories in this work ,  describing parties of Muslims as habitually indulging in the use of forbidden beverages ,  are scandalous misrepresentations of Arab manners and customs . </s> There are ,  however ,  many similar anecdotes interspersed in the works of Arab historians ,  which  ( though many of them are probably untrue in their application to particular individuals )  could not have been offered to the public by such writers if they were not of a nature consistent with the customs of a considerable class of the Arab nation . </s> In investigating this subject ,  it is necessary ,  in the first place ,  to state ,  that there is a kind of wine which Muslims are permitted to drink . </s> It is properly called  " nebeedh "   ( a name which is  _ now _  given to  _ prohibited _  kinds of wine )  ,  and is generally prepared by putting dry grapes ,  or dry dates ,  in water ,  to extract their sweetness ,  and suffering the liquor to ferment slightly ,  until it acquires a little sharpness or pungency .

The prohibition of wine hindered many of the Prophet ' s contemporaries from embracing his religion . </s> It is said that the famous poet El-Aasha ,  who was one of them ,  delayed to join his cause on this account ,  until death prevented him .
