'   ' Because I was so crooked ,  '  answered the young man ;   ' but it has quite cured me ,  and now my back is as straight as can be . </s>  '   ' I wish you would bind me to a tree ,  '  exclaimed the shepherd ,   ' so that my back would get straight . </s>  '   ' With all the pleasure in life ,  '  replied the youth . ' If you will loosen these cords I will tie you up with them as firmly as I can . </s>  '  This was soon done ,  and then the young man drove off the sheep ,  leaving their real shepherd to repent of his folly ;  and before he had gone very far he met with a horse boy and a driver of oxen ,  and he persuaded them to turn with him and to seek for adventures . </s>  By these and many other tricks he soon became so celebrated that his fame reached the king ' s ears ,  and his majesty was filled with curiosity to see the man who had managed to outwit everybody . </s>  So he commanded his guards to capture the young man and bring him before him . </s>  And when the young man stood before the king ,  the king spoke to him and said ,   ' By your tricks and the pranks that you have played on other people ,  you have ,  in the eye of the law ,  forfeited your life . </s>  But on one condition I will spare you ,  and that is ,  if you will bring me the flying horse that belongs to the great dragon . </s>  Fail in this ,  and you shall be hewn in a thousand pieces . '   ' If that is all ,  '  said the youth ,   ' you shall soon have it . </s>  '  So he went out and made his way straight to the stable where the flying horse was tethered . </s>  He stretched his hand cautiously out to seize the bridle ,  when the horse suddenly began to neigh as loud as he could . </s>  Now the room in which the dragon slept was just above the stable ,  and at the sound of the neighing he woke and cried to the horse ,   ' What is the matter ,  my treasure ?  is anything hurting you ?  '  After waiting a little while the young man tried again to loose the horse ,  but a second time it neighed so loudly that the dragon woke up in a hurry and called out to know why the horse was making such a noise . </s>  But when the same thing happened the third time ,  the dragon lost his temper ,  and went down into the stable and took a whip and gave the horse a good beating . </s>  This offended the horse and made him angry ,  and when the young man stretched out his hand to untie his head ,  he made no further fuss ,  but suffered himself to be led quietly away . </s>  Once clear of the stable the young man sprang on his back and galloped off ,  calling over his shoulder ,   ' Hi !  dragon !  dragon !  if anyone asks you what has become of your horse ,  you can say that I have got him !  '  But the king said ,   ' The flying horse is all very well ,  but I want something more . </s>  You must bring me the covering with the little bells that lies on the bed of the dragon ,  or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces . </s>  '   ' Is that all ?  '  answered the youth . ' That is easily done . '  And when night came he went away to the dragon ' s house and climbed up on to the roof . </s>  Then he opened a little window in the roof and let down the chain from which the kettle usually hung ,  and tried to hook the bed covering and to draw it up . </s>  But the little bells all began to ring ,  and the dragon woke and said to his wife ,   ' Wife ,  you have pulled off all the bed-clothes !  '  and drew the covering towards him ,  pulling ,  as he did so ,  the young man into the room . </s>  Then the dragon flung himself on the youth and bound him fast with cords saying as he tied the last knot ,   ' To-morrow when I go to church you must stay at home and kill him and cook him ,  and when I get back we will eat him together . </s>  '  So the following morning the dragoness took hold of the young man and reached down from the shelf a sharp knife with which to kill him . </s>  But as she untied the cords the better to get hold of him ,  the prisoner caught her by the legs ,  threw her to the ground ,  seized her and speedily cut her throat ,  just as she had been about to do for him ,  and put her body in the oven . </s>  Then he snatched up the covering and carried it to the king . The king was seated on his throne when the youth appeared before him and spread out the covering with a deep bow . </s>  ' That is not enough ,  '  said his majesty ;   ' you must bring me the dragon himself ,  or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces . </s>  '   ' It shall be done ,  '  answered the youth ;   ' but you must give me two years to manage it ,  for my beard must grow so that he may not know me . </s>  '   ' So be it ,  '  said the king . </s>  And the first thing the young man did when his beard was grown was to take the road to the dragon ' s house and on the way he met a beggar ,  whom he persuaded to change clothes with him ,  and in the beggar ' s garments he went fearlessly forth to the dragon . </s>  He found his enemy before his house ,  very busy making a box ,  and addressed him politely ,   ' Good morning ,  your worship . </s>  Have you a morsel of bread ?  '   ' You must wait ,  '  replied the dragon ,   ' till I have finished my box ,  and then I will see if I can find one . </s>  '   ' What will you do with the box when it is made ?  '  inquired the beggar . </s>  ' It is for the young man who killed my wife ,  and stole my flying horse and my bed covering ,  '  said the dragon . </s>  ' He deserves nothing better ,  '  answered the beggar ,   ' for it was an ill deed . Still that box is too small for him ,  for he is a big man . </s>  '   ' You are wrong ,  '  said the dragon . ' The box is large enough even for me . </s>  '   ' Well ,  the rogue is nearly as tall as you ,  '  replied the beggar ,   ' and ,  of course ,  if you can get in ,  he can . </s>  But I am sure you would find it a tight fit . '   ' No ,  there is plenty of room ,  '  said the dragon ,  tucking himself carefully inside . </s>  But no sooner was he well in ,  than the young man clapped on the lid and called out ,   ' Now press hard ,  just to see if he will be able to get out . </s>  '  The dragon pressed as hard as he could ,  but the lid never moved . ' It is all right ,  '  he cried ;   ' now you can open it . </s>  '  But instead of opening it ,  the young man drove in long nails to make it tighter still ;  then he took the box on his back and brought it to the king . </s>  And when the king heard that the dragon was inside ,  he was so excited that he would not wait one moment ,  but broke the lock and lifted the lid just a little way to make sure he was really there .

I am so young and small ,  and I would so gladly live a little longer . </s>  Be merciful and set me free ,  and I shall know how to prove my gratitude . </s>  '  Now Uraschimataro was very good-natured ,  and besides ,  he could never bear to say no ,  so he picked up the turtle ,  and put it back into the sea . </s>  Years flew by ,  and every morning Uraschimataro sailed his boat into the deep sea . </s>  But one day as he was making for a little bay between some rocks ,  there arose a fierce whirlwind ,  which shattered his boat to pieces ,  and she was sucked under by the waves . </s>  Uraschimataro himself very nearly shared the same fate .

The young man held tight ,  and marvelled where they were going and how long they were to travel ,  but for three days they rushed on ,  till at last the turtle stopped before a splendid palace ,  shining with gold and silver ,  crystal and precious stones ,  and decked here and there with branches of pale pink coral and glittering pearls . </s>  But if Uraschimataro was astonished at the beauty of the outside ,  he was struck dumb at the sight of the hall within ,  which was lighted by the blaze of fish scales . </s>  ' Where have you brought me ?

' I know your errand ,  but you shall get no bride until I have got a mate and slept by her side . </s>  '  The prince turned home again ,  and told the king and the queen what he had met at the cross-roads ;  but they thought that he should try again on the following day ,  and see whether he could not get past it ,  so that he might seek a bride in another kingdom . </s>  The prince did so ,  but got no further than the first cross-roads ;  there lay the lindorm again ,  who stopped him in the same way as before . </s>  The same thing happened on the third day when the prince tried to get past :  the lindorm said ,  with a threatening voice ,  that before the prince could get a bride he himself must find a mate . </s>  When the king and queen heard this for the third time they could think of no better plan than to invite the lindorm to the palace ,  and they should find him a mate . </s>  They thought that a lindorm would be quite well satisfied with anyone that they might give him ,  and so they would get some slave-woman to marry the monster . </s>  The lindorm came to the palace and received a bride of this kind ,  but in the morning she lay torn in pieces . </s>  So it happened every time that the king and queen compelled any woman to be his bride .

Thus a year passed away ,  and the Princess had a son ,  whom she called Benjamin . </s>  But her mother still thought the whole matter very strange . </s>  At last she said to the King that he ought to ask his daughter whether she would not like to have another husband instead of the Crab ?  But when the daughter was questioned she only answered :   ' I am married to the Crab ,  and him only will I have . </s>  '  Then the King said to her ,   ' I will appoint a tournament in your honour ,  and I will invite all the princes in the world to it ,  and if any one of them pleases you ,  you shall marry him . </s>  '  In the evening the Princess told this to the Crab ,  who said to her ,   ' Take this rod ,  go to the garden gate and knock with it ,  then a black man will come out and say to you ,   '  ' Why have you called me ,  and what do you require of me ?  '  '  Answer him thus :   ' Your master the King has sent me hither to tell you to send him his golden armour and his steed and the silver apple . </s>  '  '  And bring them to me . '  The Princess did so ,  and brought him what he desired . The following evening the Prince dressed himself for the tournament . </s>  Before he went he said to his wife ,   ' Now mind you do not say when you see me that I am the Crab .

'  The Princess in her fright exclaimed ,   ' That is the Crab himself !  '  Her mother was still more angry because she had not been told sooner ,  ran into her daughter ' s room where the crab-shell was still lying ,  took it up and threw it into the fire .

'  So he walked on about a hundred yards ,  and then he heard above him in the branches such a screaming and chirping that he looked up ,  and there he saw a heap of birds tearing a cloth with their beaks and feet ,  shrieking ,  tugging ,  and fighting ,  as if each wanted it for himself . </s>  ' Well ,  '  said the Hunter ,   ' this is wonderful !  It is just as the old woman said '  ;  and he took his gun on his shoulder ,  pulled the trigger ,  and shot into the midst of them ,  so that their feathers flew about . </s>  Then the flock took flight with much screaming ,  but one fell dead ,  and the cloak fluttered down . </s>  Then the Hunter did as the old woman had told him :  he cut open the bird ,  found its heart ,  swallowed it ,  and took the cloak home with him . </s>  The next morning when he awoke he remembered the promise ,  and wanted to see if it had come true . </s>  But when he lifted up his pillow ,  there sparkled the gold piece ,  and the next morning he found another ,  and so on every time he got up . </s>  He collected a heap of gold ,  but at last he thought to himself ,   ' What good is all my gold to me if I stay at home ?  I will travel and look a bit about me in the world . </s>  '  So he took leave of his parents ,  slung his hunting knapsack and his gun round him ,  and journeyed into the world . </s>  It happened that one day he went through a thick wood ,  and when he came to the end of it there lay in the plain before him a large castle . </s>  At one of the windows in it stood an old woman with a most beautiful maiden by her side ,  looking out . </s>  But the old woman was a witch ,  and she said to the girl ,   ' There comes one out of the wood who has a wonderful treasure in his body which we must manage to possess ourselves of ,  darling daughter ;  we have more right to it than he . </s>  He has a bird ' s heart in him ,  and so every morning there lies a gold piece under his pillow . </s>  '  She told her how they could get hold of it ,  and how she was to coax it from him ,  and at last threatened her angrily ,  saying ,   ' And if you do not obey me ,  you shall repent it !  '  When the Hunter came nearer he saw the maiden ,  and said to himself ,   ' I have travelled so far now that I will rest ,  and turn into this beautiful castle ;  money I have in plenty . </s>  '  But the real reason was that he had caught sight of the lovely face . He went into the house ,  and was kindly received and hospitably entertained . </s>  It was not long before he was so much in love with the witch-maiden that he thought of nothing else ,  and only looked in her eyes ,  and whatever she wanted ,  that he gladly did . </s>  Then the old witch said ,   ' Now we must have the bird-heart ;  he will not feel when it is gone . </s>  '  She prepared a drink ,  and when it was ready she poured it in a goblet and gave it to the maiden ,  who had to hand it to the hunter . </s>  ' Drink to me now ,  my dearest ,  '  she said .

'  The old witch grew angry ,  and said ,   ' Such a cloak is a wonderful thing ,  it is seldom to be had in the world ,  and have it I must and will . </s>  '  She beat the maiden ,  and said that if she did not obey it would go ill with her . </s>  So she did her mother ' s bidding ,  and ,  standing one day by the window ,  she looked away into the far distance as if she were very sad . </s>  ' Why are you standing there looking so sad ?  '  asked the Hunter . ' Alas ,  my love ,  '  she replied ,   ' over there lies the granite mountain where the costly precious stones grow . </s>  I have a great longing to go there ,  so that when I think of it I am very sad . For who can fetch them ?  Only the birds who fly ;  a man ,  never . </s>  '   ' If you have no other trouble ,  '  said the Hunter ,   ' that one I can easily remove from your heart . </s>  '  So he wrapped her round in his cloak and wished themselves to the granite mountain ,  and in an instant there they were ,  sitting on it !  The precious stones sparkled so brightly on all sides that it was a pleasure to see them ,  and they collected the most beautiful and costly together . </s>  But now the old witch had through her caused the Hunter ' s eyes to become heavy . </s>  He said to the maiden ,   ' We will sit down for a little while and rest ;  I am so tired that I can hardly stand on my feet . </s>  '  So they sat down ,  and he laid his head on her lap and fell asleep . </s>  As soon as he was sound asleep she unfastened the cloak from his shoulders ,  threw it on her own ,  left the granite and stones ,  and wished herself home again . </s>  But when the Hunter had finished his sleep and awoke ,  he found that his love had betrayed him and left him alone on the wild mountain . </s>  ' Oh ,  '  said he ,   ' why is faithlessness so great in the world ?  '  and he sat down in sorrow and trouble ,  not knowing what to do . </s>  But the mountain belonged to fierce and huge giants ,  who lived on it and traded there ,  and he had not sat long before he saw three of them striding towards him . </s>  So he lay down as if he had fallen into a deep sleep . </s>  The giants came up ,  and the first pushed him with his foot ,  and said ,   ' What sort of an earthworm is that ?  '  The second said ,   ' Crush him dead .

But he tied up all his gold in her apron ,  slung it like a bundle over his shoulder ,  put the tinder-box in his pocket ,  and set out towards the town . </s>  It was a splendid town !  He turned into the finest inn ,  ordered the best chamber and his favourite dinner ;  for now that he had so much money he was really rich . </s>  It certainly occurred to the servant who had to clean his boots that they were astonishingly old boots for such a rich lord . </s>  But that was because he had not yet bought new ones ;  next day he appeared in respectable boots and fine clothes . </s>  Now ,  instead of a common soldier he had become a noble lord ,  and the people told him about all the grand doings of the town and the King ,  and what a beautiful Princess his daughter was . </s>  ' How can one get to see her ?  '  asked the Soldier . </s>  ' She is never to be seen at all !  '  they told him ;   ' she lives in a great copper castle ,  surrounded by many walls and towers !

And the Soldier liked that . </s>  But as he was always spending money ,  and never made any more ,  at last the day came when he had nothing left but two shillings ,  and he had to leave the beautiful rooms in which he had been living ,  and go into a little attic under the roof ,  and clean his own boots ,  and mend them with a darning-needle .

'  asked her husband one morning . </s>  ' You have everything you want ;  why cannot you be merry like other women ?  '   ' Leave me alone ,  and do not seek to know the reason ,  '  replied she ,  bursting into tears ,  and the man thought that it was no time to question her ,  and went away to his work . </s>  He could not ,  however ,  forget all about it ,  and a few days after he inquired again the reason of her sadness ,  but only got the same reply . </s>  At length he felt he could bear it no longer ,  and tried a third time ,  and then his wife turned and answered him . </s>  ' Good gracious !  '  cried she ,   ' why cannot you let things be as they are ?  If I were to tell you ,  you would become just as wretched as myself . </s>  If you would only believe ,  it is far better for you to know nothing . '  But no man yet was ever content with such an answer . </s>  The more you beg him not to inquire ,  the greater is his curiosity to learn the whole . </s>  ' Well ,  if you MUST know ,  '  said the wife at last ,   ' I will tell you . </s>  There is no luck in this house -- no luck at all !  '   ' Is not your cow the best milker in all the village ?  Are not your trees as full of fruit as your hives are full of bees ?  Has anyone cornfields like ours ?  Really you talk nonsense when you say things like that !  '   ' Yes ,  all that you say is true ,  but we have no children . </s>  '  Then Stan understood ,  and when a man once understands and has his eyes opened it is no longer well with him . </s>  From that day the little house in the outskirts contained an unhappy man as well as an unhappy woman . And at the sight of her husband ' s misery the woman became more wretched than ever . </s>  And so matters went on for some time . Some weeks had passed ,  and Stan thought he would consult a wise man who lived a day ' s journey from his own house . </s>  The wise man was sitting before his door when he came up ,  and Stan fell on his knees before him . ' Give me children ,  my lord ,  give me children . </s>  '   ' Take care what you are asking ,  '  replied the wise man . </s>  ' Will not children be a burden to you ?  Are you rich enough to feed and clothe them ?  '   ' Only give them to me ,  my lord ,  and I will manage somehow !  '  and at a sign from the wise man Stan went his way . </s>  He reached home that evening tired and dusty ,  but with hope in his heart . </s>  As he drew near his house a sound of voices struck upon his ear ,  and he looked up to see the whole place full of children . </s>  Children in the garden ,  children in the yard ,  children looking out of every window -- it seemed to the man as if all the children in the world must be gathered there . </s>  And none was bigger than the other ,  but each was smaller than the other ,  and every one was more noisy and more impudent and more daring than the rest ,  and Stan gazed and grew cold with horror as he realised that they all belonged to him . </s>  ' Good gracious !  how many there are !  how many !  '  he muttered to himself . </s>  ' Oh ,  but not one too many ,  '  smiled his wife ,  coming up with a crowd more children clinging to her skirts . </s>  But even she found that it was not so easy to look after a hundred children ,  and when a few days had passed and they had eaten up all the food there was in the house ,  they began to cry ,   ' Father !  I am hungry -- I am hungry ,  '  till Stan scratched his head and wondered what he was to do next . </s>  It was not that he thought there were too many children ,  for his life had seemed more full of joy since they appeared ,  but now it came to the point he did not know how he was to feed them . </s>  The cow had ceased to give milk ,  and it was too early for the fruit trees to ripen . </s>  ' Do you know ,  old woman !  '  said he one day to his wife ,   ' I must go out into the world and try to bring back food somehow ,  though I cannot tell where it is to come from . </s>  '  To the hungry man any road is long ,  and then there was always the thought that he had to satisfy a hundred greedy children as well as himself . </s>  Stan wandered ,  and wandered ,  and wandered ,  till he reached to the end of the world ,  where that which is ,  is mingled with that which is not ,  and there he saw ,  a little way off ,  a sheepfold ,  with seven sheep in it . </s>  In the shadow of some trees lay the rest of the flock . </s>  Stan crept up ,  hoping that he might manage to decoy some of them away quietly ,  and drive them home for food for his family ,  but he soon found this could not be . </s>  For at midnight he heard a rushing noise ,  and through the air flew a dragon ,  who drove apart a ram ,  a sheep ,  and a lamb ,  and three fine cattle that were lying down close by . </s>  And besides these he took the milk of seventy-seven sheep ,  and carried it home to his old mother ,  that she might bathe in it and grow young again . And this happened every night . </s>  The shepherd bewailed himself in vain :  the dragon only laughed ,  and Stan saw that this was not the place to get food for his family . </s>  But though he quite understood that it was almost hopeless to fight against such a powerful monster ,  yet the thought of the hungry children at home clung to him like a burr ,  and would not be shaken off ,  and at last he said to the shepherd ,   ' What will you give me if I rid you of the dragon ?  '   ' One of every three rams ,  one of every three sheep ,  one of every three lambs ,  '  answered the herd . </s>  ' It is a bargain ,  '  replied Stan ,  though at the moment he did not know how ,  supposing he DID come off the victor ,  he would ever be able to drive so large a flock home . </s>  However ,  that matter could be settled later . At present night was not far off ,  and he must consider how best to fight with the dragon . </s>  Just at midnight ,  a horrible feeling that was new and strange to him came over Stan -- a feeling that he could not put into words even to himself ,  but which almost forced him to give up the battle and take the shortest road home again . </s>  He half turned ;  then he remembered the children ,  and turned back . ' You or I ,  '  said Stan to himself ,  and took up his position on the edge of the flock . </s>  ' Stop !  '  he suddenly cried ,  as the air was filled with a rushing noise ,  and the dragon came dashing past . ' Dear me !  '  exclaimed the dragon ,  looking round . </s>  ' Who are you ,  and where do you come from ?  '   ' I am Stan Bolovan ,  who eats rocks all night ,  and in the day feeds on the flowers of the mountain ;  and if you meddle with those sheep I will carve a cross on your back . </s>  '  When the dragon heard these words he stood quite still in the middle of the road ,  for he knew he had met with his match . </s>  ' But you will have to fight me first ,  '  he said in a trembling voice ,  for when you faced him properly he was not brave at all .

Now ,  do not be a dog in the manger ,  for if  _ you _  get all you want ,  what can it matter to you if  _ I _  am rich or poor ?  "  At last ,  though it went sorely against the grain to be of any benefit to a money-lender ,  the farmer was forced to yield ,  and from that time ,  no matter what he gained by the power of the conch ,  the money-lender gained double . </s>  And the knowledge that this was so preyed upon the farmer ' s mind day and night ,  so that he had no satisfaction out of anything . </s>  At last ,  there came a very dry season ,  -- so dry that the farmer ' s crops withered for want of rain . </s>  Then he blew his conch ,  and wished for a well to water them ,  and lo !  there was the well ,   _ but the money-lender had two !  _  -- two beautiful new wells !  This was too much for any farmer to stand ;  and our friend brooded over it ,  and brooded over it ,  till at last a bright idea came into his head . </s>  He seized the conch ,  blew it loudly ,  and cried out ,   " Oh ,  Ram !  I wish to be blind of one eye !

"  Then when the men hurried to the spot where the voice came from ,  he was no longer there ,  but from a different place cried out :   " Ha ,  Ha !  here I am !  "  So the sentinels kept jumping about ,  but so cleverly did Tom move from one spot to another ,  that they were obliged to run around the whole time ,  hoping to find somebody ,  until at length ,  quite tired out ,  they went off . </s>  Then Tomb Thumb went on with his work ,  and one after another he threw all the coins out of the window ,  but the very last he sounded and rang with all his might and springing nimbly upon it ,  so flew through the window . </s>  The robbers were loud in their praises . </s>  " Indeed you are a brave fellow ,  "  they said ,   " will you be our captain ?  "  Tom Thumb ,  thanking them ,  declined this honor ,  for he was anxious to see more of the world . </s>  Then the booty was apportioned out ,  but only a ducat was given to the little tailor ,  for that was as much as he could carry . </s>  So Tom girded on his sword again ,  and bidding farewell to the robbers ,  continued his travels . </s>  He tried to get work under various masters ,  but they would have nothing to do with him ,  so after a while he took service at an inn . </s>  But the maids there disliked him ,  for he was about everywhere ,  and saw all that went on ,  without being seen himself ;  and he told their mistress of their dishonest ways ,  of what was taken off the plates ,  and from out the cellars . </s>  So they threatened they would drown him ,  if they caught him ,  and determined to do him some harm . </s>  Then ,  one day ,  a maid mowing in the garden saw Tom Thumb running in and out between the blades of grass ,  so she cut the grass ,  in great haste ,  just where he chanced to be ,  tied it all in a bundle ,  and ,  without anyone knowing ,  threw it to the cows . </s>  Then one big black cow took up a mouthful of grass directly ,  with Tom in it ,  and swallowed it down ;  without doing him any damage ,  however . </s>  But Tom did not approve of his position ,  for it was pitch dark down there ,  with no light burning . </s>  When milking time came ,  he shouted --     " Drip ,  drap ,  drop ,    Will the milking soon stop ?  "  but the sound of the milk trickling into the pail prevented his voice being heard . </s>  Not long afterwards the master came into the shed ,  and said :   " I will have that cow killed to-morrow . </s>  "  This put Tom Thumb into a great fright ,  and he called out loudly :   " Please let me out ,  here I am inside . </s>  "  This the master heard plainly enough ,  but could not make out where the voice came from . " Where are you ?  "  he inquired . " In the black cow ,  "  was the reply . </s>  However ,  the master could not understand what was meant ,  and so went away . </s>  The following morning the cow was killed ,  but fortunately in the cutting up the knife did not touch Tom Thumb ,  who was put aside with the meat that was to be made into sausages .

"  The prince was less surprised but no less firm than on the former occasion ,  and begged his father not to press the subject ,  adding that it was quite useless to urge him any longer . </s>  This answer much distressed the king ,  who again confided his trouble to his vizir . </s>  " I have followed your advice ,  "  he said ;   " but Camaralzaman declines to marry ,  and is more obstinate than ever . </s>  "   " Sire ,  "  replied the vizir ,   " much is gained by patience ,  and your Majesty might regret any violence . </s>  Why not wait another year and then inform the Prince in the midst of the assembled council that the good of the state demands his marriage ?   He cannot possibly refuse again before so distinguished an assemblage ,  and in our immediate presence . </s>  "  The Sultan ardently desired to see his son married at once ,  but he yielded to the vizir ' s arguments and decided to wait . </s>  He then visited the prince ' s mother ,  and after telling her of his disappointment and of the further respite he had given his son ,  he added :   " I know that Camaralzaman confides more in you than he does in me . </s>  Pray speak very seriously to him on this subject ,  and make him realize that he will most seriously displease me if he remains obstinate ,  and that he will certainly regret the measures I shall be obliged to take to enforce my will . </s>  "  So the first time the Sultana Fatima saw her son she told him she had heard of his refusal to marry ,  adding how distressed she felt that he should have vexed his father so much . </s>  She asked what reasons he could have for his objections to obey . </s>  " Madam ,  "  replied the prince ,   " I make no doubt that there are as many good ,  virtuous ,  sweet ,  and amiable women as there are others very much the reverse . </s>  Would that all were like you !   But what revolts me is the idea of marrying a woman without knowing anything at all about her . </s>  My father will ask the hand of the daughter of some neighbouring sovereign ,  who will give his consent to our union . </s>  Be she fair or frightful ,  clever or stupid ,  good or bad ,  I must marry her ,  and am left no choice in the matter . </s>  How am I to know that she will not be proud ,  passionate ,  contemptuous ,  and recklessly extravagant ,  or that her disposition will in any way suit mine ?  "   " But ,  my son ,  "  urged Fatima ,   " you surely do not wish to be the last of a race which has reigned so long and so gloriously over this kingdom ?  "   " Madam ,  "  said the prince ,   " I have no wish to survive the king ,  my father ,  but should I do so I will try to reign in such a manner as may be considered worthy of my predecessors . </s>  "  These and similar conversations proved to the Sultan how useless it was to argue with his son ,  and the year elapsed without bringing any change in the prince ' s ideas . </s>  At length a day came when the Sultan summoned him before the council ,  and there informed him that not only his own wishes but the good of the empire demanded his marriage ,  and desired him to give his answer before the assembled ministers . </s>  At this Camaralzaman grew so angry and spoke with so much heat that the king ,  naturally irritated at being opposed by his son in full council ,  ordered the prince to be arrested and locked up in an old tower ,  where he had nothing but a very little furniture ,  a few books ,  and a single slave to wait on him . </s>  Camaralzaman ,  pleased to be free to enjoy his books ,  showed himself very indifferent to his sentence . </s>  When night came he washed himself ,  performed his devotions ,  and ,  having read some pages of the Koran ,  lay down on a couch ,  without putting out the light near him ,  and was soon asleep . </s>  Now there was a deep well in the tower in which Prince Camaralzaman was imprisoned ,  and this well was a favourite resort of the fairy Maimoune ,  daughter of Damriat ,  chief of a legion of genii .

Where could he be ?  Nobody knew ;  nobody could give any intelligence . </s>  All the boys knew was ,  that they had seen him tie his sledge to another large and splendid one ,  which drove down the street and out of the town . </s>  Nobody knew where he was ;  many sad tears were shed ,  and little Gerda wept long and bitterly ;  at last she said he must be dead ;  that he had been drowned in the river which flowed close to the town . </s>  Oh !  those were very long and dismal winter evenings !  At last spring came ,  with its warm sunshine . " Kay is dead and gone !  "  said little Gerda . </s>  " That I do not believe ,  "  said the Sunshine . " Kay is dead and gone !  "  said she to the Swallows . </s>  " That I do not believe ,  "  said they :  and at last little Gerda did not think so any longer either . </s>  " I will put on my red shoes ,  "  said she ,  one morning ;   " Kay has never seen them ,  and then I will go down to the river and ask there . </s>  "  It was quite early ;  she kissed her old grandmother ,  who was still asleep ,  put on her red shoes ,  and went alone to the river . </s>  " Is it true that you have taken my little playfellow ?  I will make you a present of my red shoes ,  if you will give him back to me . </s>  "  And ,  as it seemed to her ,  the blue waves nodded in a strange manner ;  then she took off her red shoes ,  the most precious things she possessed ,  and threw them both into the river . </s>  But they fell close to the bank ,  and the little waves bore them immediately to land ;  it was as if the stream would not take what was dearest to her ;  for in reality it had not got little Kay ;  but Gerda thought that she had not thrown the shoes out far enough ,  so she clambered into a boat which lay among the rushes ,  went to the farthest end ,  and threw out the shoes . </s>  But the boat was not fastened ,  and the motion which she occasioned ,  made it drift from the shore . </s>  She observed this ,  and hastened to get back ;  but before she could do so ,  the boat was more than a yard from the land ,  and was gliding quickly onward . </s>  Little Gerda was very frightened ,  and began to cry ;  but no one heard her except the sparrows ,  and they could not carry her to land ;  but they flew along the bank ,  and sang as if to comfort her ,   " Here we are !  Here we are !  "  The boat drifted with the stream ,  little Gerda sat quite still without shoes ,  for they were swimming behind the boat ,  but she could not reach them ,  because the boat went much faster than they did . </s>  The banks on both sides were beautiful ;  lovely flowers ,  venerable trees ,  and slopes with sheep and cows ,  but not a human being was to be seen . </s>  " Perhaps the river will carry me to little Kay ,  "  said she ;  and then she grew less sad . She rose ,  and looked for many hours at the beautiful green banks . </s>  Presently she sailed by a large cherry-orchard ,  where was a little cottage with curious red and blue windows ;  it was thatched ,  and before it two wooden soldiers stood sentry ,  and presented arms when anyone went past . </s>  Gerda called to them ,  for she thought they were alive ;  but they ,  of course ,  did not answer . </s>  She came close to them ,  for the stream drifted the boat quite near the land . </s>  Gerda called still louder ,  and an old woman then came out of the cottage ,  leaning upon a crooked stick . She had a large broad-brimmed hat on ,  painted with the most splendid flowers . </s>  " Poor little child !  "  said the old woman . </s>  " How did you get upon the large rapid river ,  to be driven about so in the wide world !  "  And then the old woman went into the water ,  caught hold of the boat with her crooked stick ,  drew it to the bank ,  and lifted little Gerda out . </s>  And Gerda was so glad to be on dry land again ;  but she was rather afraid of the strange old woman . </s>  " But come and tell me who you are ,  and how you came here ,  "  said she . </s>  And Gerda told her all ;  and the old woman shook her head and said ,   " A-hem !  a-hem !  "  and when Gerda had told her everything ,  and asked her if she had not seen little Kay ,  the woman answered that he had not passed there ,  but he no doubt would come ;  and she told her not to be cast down ,  but taste her cherries ,  and look at her flowers ,  which were finer than any in a picture-book ,  each of which could tell a whole story . </s>  She then took Gerda by the hand ,  led her into the little cottage ,  and locked the door . </s>  The windows were very high up ;  the glass was red ,  blue ,  and green ,  and the sunlight shone through quite wondrously in all sorts of colors . </s>  On the table stood the most exquisite cherries ,  and Gerda ate as many as she chose ,  for she had permission to do so . </s>  While she was eating ,  the old woman combed her hair with a golden comb ,  and her hair curled and shone with a lovely golden color around that sweet little face ,  which was so round and so like a rose . </s>  " I have often longed for such a dear little girl ,  "  said the old woman . </s>  " Now you shall see how well we agree together "  ;  and while she combed little Gerda ' s hair ,  the child forgot her foster-brother Kay more and more ,  for the old woman understood magic ;  but she was no evil being ,  she only practised witchcraft a little for her own private amusement ,  and now she wanted very much to keep little Gerda . </s>  She therefore went out in the garden ,  stretched out her crooked stick towards the rose-bushes ,  which ,  beautifully as they were blowing ,  all sank into the earth and no one could tell where they had stood . </s>  The old woman feared that if Gerda should see the roses ,  she would then think of her own ,  would remember little Kay ,  and run away from her . </s>  She now led Gerda into the flower-garden . </s>  Oh ,  what odour and what loveliness was there !  Every flower that one could think of ,  and of every season ,  stood there in fullest bloom ;  no picture-book could be gayer or more beautiful . </s>  Gerda jumped for joy ,  and played till the sun set behind the tall cherry-tree ;  she then had a pretty bed ,  with a red silken coverlet filled with blue violets . </s>  She fell asleep ,  and had as pleasant dreams as ever a queen on her wedding-day . </s>  The next morning she went to play with the flowers in the warm sunshine ,  and thus passed away a day . </s>  Gerda knew every flower ;  and ,  numerous as they were ,  it still seemed to Gerda that one was wanting ,  though she did not know which . </s>  One day while she was looking at the hat of the old woman painted with flowers ,  the most beautiful of them all seemed to her to be a rose . </s>  The old woman had forgotten to take it from her hat when she made the others vanish in the earth . But so it is when one ' s thoughts are not collected . " What !  "  said Gerda . </s>  " Are there no roses here ?  "  and she ran about amongst the flowerbeds ,  and looked ,  and looked ,  but there was not one to be found . </s>  She then sat down and wept ;  but her hot tears fell just where a rose-bush had sunk ;  and when her warm tears watered the ground ,  the tree shot up suddenly as fresh and blooming as when it had been swallowed up . </s>  Gerda kissed the roses ,  thought of her own dear roses at home ,  and with them of little Kay . " Oh ,  how long I have stayed !  "  said the little girl . </s>  " I intended to look for Kay !  Do not you know where he is ?  "  she asked of the roses .

In the middle of the bush sat a friendly-looking old woman in a most strange dress . </s>  It was quite green ,  like the leaves of the elder ,  and was trimmed with large white Elder-flowers ;  so that at first one could not tell whether it was a stuff ,  or a natural green and real flowers . </s>  " What ' s that woman ' s name ?

No matter . </s>  The Fool of the World set off with his bag over his shoulder ,  singing as he went ,  for he was off to seek his fortune and marry the Tzar ' s daughter . </s>  He was sorry his mother had not given him any corn brandy ;  but he sang merrily for all that . </s>  He would have liked white rolls instead of the dry black crusts ;  but ,  after all ,  the main thing on a journey is to have something to eat . </s>  So he trudged merrily along the road ,  and sang because the trees were green and there was a blue sky overhead . </s>  He had not gone very far when he met an ancient old man with a bent back ,  and a long beard ,  and eyes hidden under his bushy eyebrows . </s>  " Good-day ,  young fellow ,  "  says the ancient old man .

Instantly the ship leapt up into the air ,  and sailed away over the tops of the trees . </s>  The little ship answered the tiller as readily as if she were sailing in water ,  and the Fool steered for the highroad ,  and sailed along above it ,  for he was afraid of losing his way if he tried to steer a course across the open country . </s>  He flew on and on ,  and looked down ,  and saw a man lying in the road below him with his ear on the damp ground . </s>  " Good-day to you ,  uncle ,  "  cried the Fool .

Anticipating no good ,  my brother commanded the oarsmen to turn the vessel ,  and make for land . </s>  His apprehensions seemed ,  indeed ,  to be confirmed ,  for the boat quickly approached that of my brother ,  and getting ahead of it ,   ( for it had more rowers ,  )  ran between it and the land . </s>  The young girls ,  moreover ,  when they knew the danger to which they were exposed ,  sprang up with cries and lamentations :  in vain Mustapha sought to quiet them ,  in vain enjoined upon them to be still ,  lest their running to and fro should upset the vessel . </s>  It was of no avail ;  and when ,  in consequence of the proximity of the other boat ,  all ran upon the further side ,  it was upset . </s>  Meanwhile ,  they had observed from the land the approach of the strange boat ,  and ,  inasmuch as ,  for some time back ,  they had been in anxiety on account of Corsairs ,  their suspicions were excited ,  and several boats put off from the land to their assistance :  but they only came in time to pick up the drowning . </s>  In the confusion ,  the hostile boat escaped . In both barks ,  however ,  which had taken in those who were preserved ,  they were uncertain whether all had been saved . </s>  They approached each other ,  and ,  alas !  found that my sister and one of her companions were missing ;  at the same time ,  in their number a stranger was discovered ,  who was known to none . </s>  In answer to Mustapha ' s threats ,  he confessed that he belonged to the hostile ship ,  which was lying at anchor two miles to the eastward ,  and that his companions had left him behind in their hasty flight ,  while he was engaged in assisting to pick up the maidens ;  moreover ,  he said he had seen two taken on board their boat . </s>  The grief of my old father was without bounds ,  but Mustapha also was afflicted unto death ,  for not only had his beloved sister been lost ,  and did he accuse himself of having been the cause of her misfortune ,  but ,  also ,  her companion who had shared it with her ,  had been promised to him by her parents as his wife ;  still had he not dared to avow it to our father ,  because her family was poor ,  and of low descent . </s>  My father ,  however ,  was a stern man ;  as soon as his sorrow had subsided a little ,  he called Mustapha before him ,  and thus spake to him :  --   " Thy folly has deprived me of the consolation of my old age ,  and the joy of my eyes . </s>  Go !  I banish thee forever from my sight !  I curse thee and thine offspring -- and only when thou shalt restore to me my Fatima ,  shall thy head be entirely free from a father ' s execrations !  "  This my poor brother had not expected ;  already ,  before this ,  he had determined to go in search of his sister and her friend ,  after having asked the blessing of his father upon his efforts ,  and now that father had sent him forth into the world ,  laden with his curse . </s>  As ,  however ,  his former grief had bowed him down ,  so this consummation of misfortune ,  which he had not deserved ,  tended to steel his mind . </s>  He went to the imprisoned pirate ,  and ,  demanding whither the ship was bound ,  learned that she carried on a trade in slaves ,  and usually had a great sale thereof in Balsora . </s>  On his return to the house ,  in order to prepare for his journey ,  the anger of his father seemed to have subsided a little ,  for he sent him a purse full of gold ,  to support him during his travels . </s>  Mustapha ,  thereupon ,  in tears took leave of the parents of Zoraida ,   ( for so his affianced was called ,  )  and set out upon the route to Balsora . </s>  Mustapha travelled by land ,  because from our little city there was no ship that went direct to Balsora . </s>  He was obliged ,  therefore ,  to use all expedition ,  in order not to arrive too long after the sea-robbers . </s>  Having a good horse and no luggage ,  he hoped to reach this city by the end of the sixth day . </s>  On the evening of the fourth ,  however ,  as he was riding all alone upon his way ,  three men came suddenly upon him . </s>  Having observed that they were well-armed and powerful men ,  and sought his money and his horse ,  rather than his life ,  he cried out that he would yield himself to them . </s>  They dismounted ,  and tied his feet together under his horse ;  then they placed him in their midst ,  and ,  without a word spoken ,  trotted quickly away with him ;  one of them having seized his bridle . </s>  Mustapha gave himself up to a feeling of gloomy despair ;  the curse of his father seemed already to be undergoing its accomplishment on the unfortunate one ,  and how could he hope to save his sister and Zoraida ,  should he ,  robbed of all his means ,  even be able to devote his poor life to their deliverance ?  Mustapha and his silent companions might have ridden about an hour ,  when they entered a little valley . </s>  The vale was enclosed by lofty trees ;  a soft ,  dark-green turf ,  and a stream which ran swiftly through its midst ,  invited to repose . </s>  In this place were pitched from fifteen to twenty tents ,  to the stakes of which were fastened camels and fine horses :  from one of these tents distinctly sounded the melody of a guitar ,  blended with two fine manly voices . </s>  It seemed to my brother as if people who had chosen so blithesome a resting-place ,  could have no evil intentions towards himself ;  and accordingly ,  without apprehension ,  he obeyed the summons of his conductors ,  who had unbound his feet ,  and made signs to him to follow . </s>  They led him into a tent which was larger than the rest ,  and on the inside was magnificently fitted up . </s>  Splendid cushions embroidered with gold ,  woven carpets ,  gilded censers ,  would elsewhere have bespoken opulence and respectability ,  but here seemed only the booty of a robber band . </s>  Upon one of the cushions an old and small-sized man was reclining :  his countenance was ugly ;  a dark-brown and shining skin ,  a disgusting expression around his eyes ,  and a mouth of malicious cunning ,  combined to render his whole appearance odious . </s>  Although this man sought to put on a commanding air ,  still Mustapha soon perceived that not for him was the tent so richly adorned ,  and the conversation of his conductors seemed to confirm him in his opinion . </s>  " Where is the Mighty ?  "  inquired they of the little man . " He is out upon a short hunt ,  "  was the answer ;   " but he has commissioned me to attend to his affairs . </s>  "   " That has he not wisely done ,  "  rejoined one of the robbers ;   " for it must soon be determined whether this dog is to die or be ransomed ,  and that the Mighty knows better than thou .

" I can always kill enough beasts to provide a sufficiency of food . </s>  "  But the drought had withered away the grass and the trees ,  and the shortage of such food had greatly reduced the number of animals . The king found the forests empty of deer and birds . </s>  Still he failed to realize the gravity of the situation and what he considered an exceedingly bright idea struck him . " I will explore the unknown territory beyond the barrier of rocky hills ,  "  he said . </s>  " Surely there will I find a land of plenty . And ,  at least "  he added ,   " it will be a pleasant adventure with good hunting . </s>  "  A great expedition was therefore arranged ,  and the king and his hunting companions set forth to find a path over the rocks . </s>  This was not at all difficult ,  and on the third day ,  a pass was discovered among the crags and peaks that formed the summit of the barrier ,  and the king saw the region beyond . </s>  It seemed a vast and beautiful land ,  stretching away as far as the eye could see in a forest of huge trees . </s>  Carefully ,  the hunters descended the other side of the rock barrier and entered the unknown land . It seemed uninhabited . Nor was there any sign of beast or bird of any kind . </s>  No sound disturbed the stillness of the forest ,  no tracks were visible . As well as the hunters could make out ,  no foot had ever trodden the region before . Even nature seemed at rest . </s>  The trees were all old ,  their trunks gnarled into fantastic shapes ,  their leaves yellow and sere as if growth had stopped ages ago . </s>  Altogether the march through the forest was rather eerie ,  and the hunters proceeded in single file ,  which added to the impressiveness of the strange experience . </s>  The novelty ,  however ,  made it pleasant to the king ,  and he kept on his way for four days . </s>  Then the forest ended abruptly ,  and the explorers came to a vast open plain ,  a desert ,  through which a wide river flowed . Far beyond rose a mountain capped by rocks of regular shape . </s>  At any rate ,  they appeared to be rocks ,  but the distance was too great to enable anyone to speak with certainty . " Water ,  "  said the vizier ,   " is a sign of life . </s>  "  So the king decided to continue as far as the mountain . </s>  A ford was discovered in the river ,  and once on the other side it was possible to make out the rocks crowning the mountain . </s>  They looked too regular to be mere rocks ,  and on approaching nearer the king was sure that a huge building must be at the top of the mountain . </s>  When they arrived quite close ,  there was no doubt about it . Either a town ,  or a palace ,  stood on the summit ,  and it was decided to make the ascent next day . </s>  During the night no sound was heard ,  but to everybody ' s surprise a distinct path up the mountain was noticed in the morning . </s>  It was so overgrown with weeds and moss and straggling creepers that it was obvious it had not been used for a long time . </s>  The ascent was accordingly difficult ,  but half way up the first sign of life ,  noticed since the expedition began ,  made itself visible . It was an eagle . </s>  Suddenly it flew down from the mountain top and circled above the hunters ,  screaming ,  but making no attempt to attack . At length the summit was gained . </s>  It was a flat plateau of great expanse ,  almost the whole of which was covered by an enormous building of massive walls and stupendous towers . </s>  " This is the palace of a great monarch ,  "  said the king . But no entrance of any kind could be seen . </s>  The rest of the day was spent in wandering round ,  but nowhere was a door ,  or window ,  or opening visible . </s>  It was decided to make a more serious effort next morning to gain entry . However ,  it seemed a greater puzzle than ever . </s>  At length ,  one of the most venturesome of the party discovered an eagle ' s nest on one of the smallest towers ,  and with great difficulty he secured the bird and brought it down to the king . </s>  His majesty bade one of his wise men ,  Muflog ,  learned in bird languages ,  to speak to it . He did so . </s>  In a harsh croaking voice ,  the eagle replied ,   " I am but a young bird ,  only seven centuries old . I know naught . </s>  On a tower higher than that on which I dwell ,  is the eyrie of my father . He may be able to give you information . "  More he would not say . </s>  The only thing to do was to climb the higher tower and question the father eagle . </s>  This was done ,  and the bird answered :   " On a tower still higher dwells my father ,  and on yet a higher tower my grandfather ,  who is two thousand years old . </s>  He may know something . I know nothing . "  After considerable difficulty the topmost tower was reached and the venerable bird discovered . He seemed asleep and was only awakened after much coaxing . </s>  Then he surveyed the hunters warily . " Let me see ,  let me think ,  "  he muttered slowly . </s>  " I did hear ,  when I was a tiny eagle chick ,  but a few years old -- that was long ,  long ago -- that my great-grandfather had said that his great-grandfather had told him he had heard that long ,  long ,  long ago -- oh ,  ever so much longer than that -- a king lived in this palace ;  that he died and left it to the eagles ;  and that in the course of many ,  many ,  many thousands of years the door had been covered up by the dust brought by the winds . </s>  "   " Where is the door ?  "  asked Muflog . That was a puzzle the ancient bird could not answer readily . </s>  He thought and thought and fell asleep and had to be kept being awakened until at last he remembered . </s>  " When the sun shines in the morning ,  "  he croaked ,   " its first ray falls on the door . "  Then ,  worn out with all his thinking and talking ,  he fell asleep again . </s>  There was no rest for the party that night . They all watched to make certain of seeing the first ray of the rising sun strike the palace . </s>

"  he asked in a feeble voice ,  and his hand crept tremblingly along the silken coverlet of the bed as if in search of something . </s>  " I am here ,  my father ,  "  replied his son who was standing by the side of his bed . His eyes were moist with tears ,  but his voice was steady . </s>  " My son ,  "  said the old man ,  slowly ,  and with some difficulty ,   " I am about to leave this world . </s>  My soul will take flight from this frail body when the sun has sunk behind the horizon .

"      [ Illustration :  A strange crowd of demons of all shapes and    sizes poured into the synagogue with threatening gestures . </s>  (  _ Page 40 _  )  . ]   " I will ,  my father ,  "  returned Bar Shalmon ,  sobbing .

I would spare thee the pain that was mine in my early days ,  when ,  as a merchant ,  I garnered my fortune . </s>  The sea out there that will soon swallow up the sun is calm now .

" In very truth ,  I understand thee not ,  as my father understood not thine ,  "  he replied . </s>  " My father was wont to say that Mar Shalmon was strange and peradventure not possessed of all his senses to neglect his store of wealth and treasure . </s>  "  With an angry gesture Bar Shalmon stopped the captain ,  but he was sorely troubled . </s>  He recalled now that his father had often spoken mysteriously of foreign lands ,  and he wondered ,  indeed ,  whether Mar Shalmon could have been in his proper senses not to have breathed a word of his riches abroad . </s>  For days he discussed the matter with the captain ,  who at last persuaded him to make the journey . " Fear not thy vow ,  "  said the captain . </s>  " Thy worthy father must ,  of a truth ,  have been bereft of reason in failing to tell thee of his full estate ,  and an oath to a man of mind unsound is not binding . </s>  That is the law in our land . "   " So it is here ,  "  returned Bar Shalmon ,  and with this remark his last scruple vanished . </s>  He bade a tender farewell to his wife ,  his child ,  and his friends ,  and set sail on the strange ship to the land beyond the sea . </s>  For three days all went well ,  but on the fourth the ship was becalmed and the sails flapped lazily against the masts . </s>  The sailors had nothing to do but lie on deck and wait for a breeze ,  and Bar Shalmon took advantage of the occasion to treat them to a feast . </s>  Suddenly ,  in the midst of the feasting ,  they felt the ship begin to move .

" The ship is bewitched ,  "  he exclaimed . </s>  " There is no wind ,  and no current ,  and yet we are being borne along as if driven before a storm . We shall be lost . </s>  "  Panic seized the sailors ,  and Bar Shalmon was unable to pacify them . </s>  " Someone on board has brought us ill-luck ,  "  said the boatswain ,  looking pointedly at Bar Shalmon ;   " we shall have to heave him overboard . "  His comrades assented and rushed toward Bar Shalmon . </s>  Just at that moment ,  however ,  the look-out in the bow cried excitedly ,   " Land ahead !

I seek not to peer into the future to assure my own safety . </s>  "  With these words they parted ,  the rabbi returning to his prayers and to his studies which have enriched the learning of the Jews ,  while Godfrey proceeded to lay a trail of innocent Jewish blood along the banks of the Rhine in his march to Palestine . </s>  History has set on record the events of the Crusade . </s>  Godfrey ,  after many battles ,  laid siege to the Holy City ,  captured it ,  and drove the Jews into one of the synagogues and burned them alive . </s>  Eight days afterward ,  his soldiers raised him on their shields and proclaimed him king . </s>  Godfrey was delighted ,  but two days later he thought the matter over carefully and decided that he could not live in Jerusalem always . </s>  So next day he called together his captains and said :   " You have done me great honor . </s>  But I must return to Europe ,  and it would be more befitting that I should be styled Duke of Jerusalem and Guardian of the Holy City than its sovereign . </s>  "  That night ,  however ,  he suddenly remembered the prediction of Rashi . " For three days I have been King of Jerusalem ,  "  he muttered . " The rabbi of the Jews spoke truth . </s>  "  He could not help wondering whether the rest of the prophecy would be fulfilled ,  and he became moody . </s>  He was joyful when he gained a victory ,  but there came also disasters ,  and he was plunged into despondency . </s>  The reverses affected the buoyancy of his troops ,  disease decimated their ranks ,  and desertions further depleted their numbers . </s>  Slowly but surely his mighty army dwindled away to a mere handful of dissatisfied men and decrepit horses . </s>  It was a ragged and wretched procession that he led back across Europe ,  and daily his retinue grew smaller . </s>  Men and horses dropped from sheer fatigue helpless by the wayside ,  and were left there to die ,  with the hungry vultures perched on trees ,  patiently waiting for the last flicker of life to depart before they set to work to pick the bones of all flesh . </s>  Godfrey de Bouillon had gained his victory ,  but at what cost ?  Thousands of men ,  women and children had been murdered ,  thousands of his soldiers had fallen in battle ,  and now hundreds of others had dropped out of the ranks to end their last hours on the ghastly road that led from Jerusalem back to western Europe . </s>  Do you wonder that Godfrey was unhappy ,  and that he thought every moment of the words of Rashi ?  At length he reached the city of Worms where Rashi dwelt . </s>  With him were four men ,  mounted on horses . " It is well ,  "  he said ,  with as much cheerfulness as he could muster ,  as he surveyed the remnants of his once proud army . </s>  " The rabbi has failed . "  Godfrey bade his men fall into line behind him and he proudly rode through the gate of the city . As he did so ,  he heard a cry of alarm . </s>  He turned hastily and saw a huge stone falling from the city ' s gate . It dropped on the soldier riding just behind him ,  killing both man and horse . </s>  " You have spoken truth ;  would that I had taken heed of your words ,  "  he said to the rabbi . " I am a broken man . You will assuredly achieve great fame in Israel . </s>  "  And so it has come to pass . </s>  Should you ,  by chance ,  ever visit the city of Brussels ,  the capital of Belgium ,  fail not to look upon the statue of Godfrey de Bouillon ,  with his sword proudly raised . </s>  It stands in the Place Royale but a few minutes '  walk from the synagogue . </s>  Should you ever be in the ancient city of Worms that stands on the Rhine ,  do as other visitors ,  Jews and Gentiles -- enter the synagogue that was built many centuries ago ,  and you will see the room where Rashi studied and the stone seat on which he sat . </s>  And not far from the synagogue you will see the ancient gate of the city ,  named in honor of Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac ,  the Rashi Gate . </s>  Perhaps it is the very one under which Godfrey de Bouillon passed into the city with his three mounted companions ,  as the legend tells .

Despite all this ,  Princess Solima was not happy . </s>  Indeed ,  she was wretched to despondency ,  and her melancholy weighed heavily upon her father . " What ails you ,  my precious daughter ?  "  he asked her a hundred times ,  but she made no answer . </s>  She just sat and silently moped . She did not waste away ,  which puzzled the physicians ;  she did not grow pale ,  which surprised her attendants ;  and she did not weep ,  which astonished herself . </s>  But she felt as if her heart had grown heavy ,  as if there was no use in anything . </s>  The king squared his shoulders to show his determination and summoned his magicians and wizards and sorcerers and commanded them to perform their arts and solve the mystery of the illness of Princess Solima . </s>  A strange crew they were ,  ranged in a semi-circle before the king . </s>  There was the renowned astrologer from Egypt ,  a little man with a humpback ;  the mixer of mysterious potions from China ,  a long ,  lank yellow man ,  with tiny eyes ;  the alchemist from Arabia ,  a scowling man with his face almost concealed by whiskers ;  there was a Greek and a Persian and a Phoenician ,  each with some special knowledge and fearfully anxious to display it . </s>  They set to work . </s>  One studied the stars ,  another concocted a sweet-smelling fluid ,  a third retired to the woods and thought deeply ,  a fourth made abstruse calculations with diagrams and figures ,  a fifth questioned the princess '  handmaidens ,  and a sixth conceived the brilliant notion of talking with the princess herself . </s>  He was certainly an original wizard ,  and he learned more than all the others . Then they met in consultation and talked foreign languages and pretended very seriously to understand one another . </s>  One said the stars were in opposition ,  another said he had gazed into a crystal and had seen a glow-worm chasing a hippopotamus which a third interpreted as meaning the princess would die if the glow-worm won the race . </s>  " Rubbish !  "  exclaimed the magician who had spoken to the princess ;   " likewise stuff and nonsense and the equivalent thereof in the seventy unknown languages . </s>  "  That was an impertinent comment on their divinations ,  and so they listened seriously . " The princess ,  "  he said ,   " is just tired . </s>  That is a disease which will become popular and fashionable as the world grows older and more people amass riches . </s>  She is sick of being waited on hand and foot and bowed down to and all that sort of thing . </s>  She has never been allowed to romp as a child ,  to choose her own companions and the rest of it . Therefore ,  she is bored with all the etcetras . </s>  The case is comprehensible and comprehensive :  it needs the exercise of imagination stimulated by prescience ,  conscience ,  patience . . . . </s>  "  The others yawned and began to collect dictionaries ,  and fearing that they might be tempted to fling them at him after they had found the meaning of his big words ,  he ceased . </s>  " I agree ,  "  said the president of the assembly ,  the oldest wizard ,   " only I diagnose the disease in simpler form . The princess is in love . </s>  "  That set them all jabbering together ,  and they finally agreed to report to the king that the time had arrived when the princess should marry ,  so that she should be able to go away to a new land ,  amid other people and different scenes . </s>  The king agreed reluctantly ,  for he dearly loved his daughter and wished her to remain with him always if possible . </s>  Heralds and messengers were sent out far and wide ,  and very soon a procession of suitors for the princess '  hand began to file past the lady . </s>  They were princes of all shapes and sizes ,  of all complexions and colors ;  some were resplendent with jewels ,  others were followed by retinues of slaves bearing gifts ;  a few entered the competition by proxy -- that is ,  they sent somebody else to see the lady first and pronounce judgment upon her . </s>  These she dismissed summarily ,  declaring that they were disqualified by the rules of fair play . </s>  When all the entrants had been inspected by the king ,  he said to his daughter :   " Pick the one you love the best ,  Solima dear . "   " None ,  "  she answered promptly . </s>  " Dear ,  dear me -- that is very awkward . We shall have to return the entrance fees -- I mean the presents ,  "  he said . </s>  That prospect did not seem to worry the princess in the least ;  nor did her father ' s appeal not to belittle him in the eyes of his fellow monarchs have the slightest effect on her . </s>  " At least ,  "  he said ,  growing impatient ,   " tell me what you do want . </s>  "   " I will marry any man ,  "  she replied ,  while he wondered gravely what else she could have said ,   " who is not such a fool as to think himself the only person in the world who is of consequence . </s>  "  The king was not without wisdom ,  and he knew that this remark is foolish ,  or sensible ,  according to the mood in which it is said ,  and the thoughts behind it . </s>  " You do not regard any one of the princes ,  "  the king said gently ,   " as worthy of --  --  "   " Any woman ,  "  interrupted his daughter . </s>  " Listen ,  my father ,  you have tried to make me happy always and until recently you have succeeded . I wish to obey you in all things ,  even in the choice of a husband . </s>  Would you really have me marry any one of these fools ?  Be not angry . </s>  Did any one reveal a gleam of wisdom ,  or common-sense ?  Were they not all just ridiculous fops ?  Let me enumerate :   " There was Prince Hafiz who talked only of his wars -- of the men -- aye and women and children -- his soldiers had butchered . </s>  The soldiers fought and Prince Hafiz posed before me as a warrior and hero . I will not be queen in a land where people cannot live in peace . </s>  " Then there was Prince Aziz who boasted that he spends all his life with his horses and dogs and falcons in the hunting field . He knows the needs of beasts ,  but not of men . </s>  I will not be the bride of a prince who allows his subjects to starve in wretchedness and poverty while he enjoys himself with the slaughter of wild beasts . </s>  " Prince Guzman had nothing else to impart to me but his taste in jewels and dress . </s>  Prince Abdul knew exactly how many bottles of wine he drank daily ,  but he could not tell me how many schools there were in his city . </s>  Prince Hassan had not the slightest notion how the majority of his people lived ,  whether by trading ,  or thieving ,  or working ,  or begging . "  King Zuliman listened intently . </s>  This was a singular speech for a princess ,  but reason told him this was profoundest wisdom . " Oh ,  I am tired ,  "  burst out Princess Solima ,  in tears . </s>  " I have no desire for life if to be a ruler over men and women and children means that you must take no interest in their welfare . My father ,  hearken . </s>  I will not be queen in a land where the king thinks the people live only to make him great . </s>  I shall be proud and happy to reign where the king understands that it is his duty to make his people happy and his country prosperous and peaceful . </s>  "  The king left his daughter ,  and ,  deeply concerned ,  sought his wizards . " My daughter has been born thousands of years before her time ,  "  he declared ,  petulantly . </s>  " The stars have played a trick on me ,  and have sent me my great-great-great-great ever so much great granddaughter out of her turn . </s>  "  The magicians did not laugh at this :  they thought it a wonderfully sage remark ,  and after much mysterious whispering among themselves and consultation of old books ,  and gazing into crystals ,  they informed the king that the stars foretold that Princess Solima would marry a poor man !  They flattered themselves on their cleverness in arriving at this conclusion ,  which they deduced from the princess contempt for princes .

" Like unto an angel dost thou appear to me ,  "  he said . </s>  " Let thy coming bring peace ,  "  replied Jadua . </s>  Parmenio ,  the chief of Alexander ' s generals ,  had promised the soldiers rich store of plunder in Jerusalem ,  and he approached the king and said :   " Wherefore do you honor this priest of the Jews above all men ?

"  Turning to the priest ,  he said ,   " Lead me to your Temple that I may offer up thanksgiving to the God of my guardian angel . </s>  "  It was now daylight ,  and the priests walked in procession before King Alexander past cheering multitudes of people . </s>  At the Temple the king removed his sandals ,  but the priests gave him a pair of jeweled slippers ,  fearing that he might slip on the pavement . </s>  The king was pleased with all that he saw and desired that a statue of himself ,  or a portrait ,  should be placed in the holy building . </s>  " That may not be ,  "  replied the high priest ,   " but in honor of thy visit all the boys born in Jerusalem this year shall be named Alexander . </s>  "   " It is well ,  "  said the king ,  much pleased ;   " ask of me what you will ,  and if it be in my power I shall grant it . </s>  "   " Mighty monarch ,  "  said Jadua ,   " we desire naught but to be permitted to serve our God according to our laws .

It must be quite melancholy . "   " Melancholy !  what do you mean ?  "  the little creature would always reply . </s>  " Everything around me is so wonderfully bright and warm ,  and beautiful ,  that it makes me joyous . "   " But only for one day ,  and then it is all over . </s>  "   " Over !  "  repeated the fly ;   " what is the meaning of all over ?  Are you all over too ?  "   " No ;  I shall very likely live for thousands of your days ,  and my day is whole seasons long ;  indeed it is so long that you could never reckon it out . </s>  "   " No ?  then I do not understand you . You may have thousands of my days ,  but I have thousands of moments in which I can be merry and happy . </s>  Does all the beauty of the world cease when you die ?  "   " No ,  "  replied the tree ;   " it will certainly last much longer ,  -- infinitely longer than I can even think of . </s>  "   " Well ,  then ,  "  said the little fly ,   " we have the same time to live ;  only we reckon differently . </s>  "  And the little creature danced and floated in the air ,  rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet ,  rejoicing in the balmy breezes ,  laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and wild roses ,  elder-blossoms and honeysuckle ,  from the garden hedges ,  wild thyme ,  primroses ,  and mint ,  and the scent of all these was so strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly . </s>  The long and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights ,  that when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its happiness and enjoyment . </s>  Its wings could sustain it no longer ,  and gently and slowly it glided down upon the soft waving blades of grass ,  nodded its little head as well as it could nod ,  and slept peacefully and sweetly . </s>  The fly was dead . </s>  " Poor little Ephemera !  "  said the oak ;   " what a terribly short life !  "  And so ,  on every summer day the dance was repeated ,  the same questions asked ,  and the same answers given . </s>  The same thing was continued through many generations of Ephemera ;  all of them felt equally merry and equally happy . </s>  The oak remained awake through the morning of spring ,  the noon of summer ,  and the evening of autumn ;  its time of rest ,  its night drew nigh -- winter was coming . </s>  Already the storms were singing ,   " Good-night ,  good-night . "  Here fell a leaf and there fell a leaf . " We will rock you and lull you . Go to sleep ,  go to sleep . </s>  We will sing you to sleep ,  and shake you to sleep ,  and it will do your old twigs good ;  they will even crackle with pleasure . </s>  Sleep sweetly ,  sleep sweetly ,  it is your three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth night . Correctly speaking ,  you are but a youngster in the world . </s>  Sleep sweetly ,  the clouds will drop snow upon you ,  which will be quite a cover-lid ,  warm and sheltering to your feet . Sweet sleep to you ,  and pleasant dreams . </s>  "  And there stood the oak ,  stripped of all its leaves ,  left to rest during the whole of a long winter ,  and to dream many dreams of events that had happened in its life ,  as in the dreams of men . </s>  The great tree had once been small ;  indeed ,  in its cradle it had been an acorn . According to human computation ,  it was now in the fourth century of its existence . </s>  It was the largest and best tree in the forest . </s>  Its summit towered above all the other trees ,  and could be seen far out at sea ,  so that it served as a landmark to the sailors . </s>  It had no idea how many eyes looked eagerly for it . </s>  In its topmost branches the wood-pigeon built her nest ,  and the cuckoo carried out his usual vocal performances ,  and his well-known notes echoed amid the boughs ;  and in autumn ,  when the leaves looked like beaten copper plates ,  the birds of passage would come and rest upon the branches before taking their flight across the sea . </s>  But now it was winter ,  the tree stood leafless ,  so that every one could see how crooked and bent were the branches that sprang forth from the trunk . </s>  Crows and rooks came by turns and sat on them ,  and talked of the hard times which were beginning ,  and how difficult it was in winter to obtain food . </s>  It was just about holy Christmas time that the tree dreamed a dream . </s>  The tree had ,  doubtless ,  a kind of feeling that the festive time had arrived ,  and in his dream fancied he heard the bells ringing from all the churches round ,  and yet it seemed to him to be a beautiful summer ' s day ,  mild and warm . </s>  His mighty summits was crowned with spreading fresh green foliage ;  the sunbeams played among the leaves and branches ,  and the air was full of fragrance from herb and blossom ;  painted butterflies chased each other ;  the summer flies danced around him ,  as if the world had been created merely for them to dance and be merry in . </s>  All that had happened to the tree during every year of his life seemed to pass before him ,  as in a festive procession . </s>  He saw the knights of olden times and noble ladies ride by through the wood on their gallant steeds ,  with plumes waving in their hats ,  and falcons on their wrists . </s>  The hunting horn sounded ,  and the dogs barked . He saw hostile warriors ,  in colored dresses and glittering armor ,  with spear and halberd ,  pitching their tents ,  and anon striking them . </s>  The watchfires again blazed ,  and men sang and slept under the hospitable shelter of the tree . </s>  He saw lovers meet in quiet happiness near him in the moonshine ,  and carve the initials of their names in the grayish-green bark on his trunk . </s>  Once ,  but long years had intervened since then ,  guitars and Eolian harps had been hung on his boughs by merry travellers ;  now they seemed to hang there again ,  and he could hear their marvellous tones . </s>  The wood-pigeons cooed as if to explain the feelings of the tree ,  and the cuckoo called out to tell him how many summer days he had yet to live . </s>  Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of root and stem and leaf ,  rising even to the highest branches . </s>  The tree felt itself stretching and spreading out ,  while through the root beneath the earth ran the warm vigor of life . </s>  As he grew higher and still higher ,  with increased strength ,  his topmost boughs became broader and fuller ;  and in proportion to his growth ,  so was his self-satisfaction increased ,  and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher ,  to reach even to the warm ,  bright sun itself . </s>  Already had his topmost branches pierced the clouds ,  which floated beneath them like troops of birds of passage ,  or large white swans ;  every leaf seemed gifted with sight ,  as if it possessed eyes to see . </s>  The stars became visible in broad daylight ,  large and sparkling ,  like clear and gentle eyes . </s>  They recalled to the memory the well-known look in the eyes of a child ,  or in the eyes of lovers who had once met beneath the branches of the old oak .

"  she asked again ,  and pointed to her nosegay ,  which was quite withered . </s>  " Do not you know what is the matter with them ?  "  said the student . " The flowers were at a ball last night ,  and therefore ,  it is no wonder they hang their heads . </s>  "   " But flowers cannot dance ?  "  cried little Ida . " Yes indeed ,  they can ,  "  replied the student . " When it grows dark ,  and everybody is asleep ,  they jump about quite merrily . </s>  They have a ball almost every night . "   " Can children go to these balls ?  "   " Yes ,  "  said the student ,   " little daisies and lilies of the valley . </s>  "   " Where do the beautiful flowers dance ?  "  asked little Ida . </s>  " Have you not often seen the large castle outside the gates of the town ,  where the king lives in summer ,  and where the beautiful garden is full of flowers ?  And have you not fed the swans with bread when they swam towards you ?  Well ,  the flowers have capital balls there ,  believe me . </s>  "   " I was in the garden out there yesterday with my mother ,  "  said Ida ,   " but all the leaves were off the trees ,  and there was not a single flower left . </s>  Where are they ?  I used to see so many in the summer . "   " They are in the castle ,  "  replied the student . </s>  " You must know that as soon as the king and all the court are gone into the town ,  the flowers run out of the garden into the castle ,  and you should see how merry they are . </s>  The two most beautiful roses seat themselves on the throne ,  and are called the king and queen ,  then all the red cockscombs range themselves on each side ,  and bow ,  these are the lords-in-waiting . </s>  After that the pretty flowers come in ,  and there is a grand ball . The blue violets represent little naval cadets ,  and dance with hyacinths and crocuses which they call young ladies . </s>  The tulips and tiger-lilies are the old ladies who sit and watch the dancing ,  so that everything may be conducted with order and propriety . </s>  "   " But ,  "  said little Ida ,   " is there no one there to hurt the flowers for dancing in the king ' s castle ?  "   " No one knows anything about it ,  "  said the student . </s>  " The old steward of the castle ,  who has to watch there at night ,  sometimes comes in ;  but he carries a great bunch of keys ,  and as soon as the flowers hear the keys rattle ,  they run and hide themselves behind the long curtains ,  and stand quite still ,  just peeping their heads out . </s>  Then the old steward says ,   ' I smell flowers here ,  '  but he cannot see them . "   " Oh how capital ,  "  said little Ida ,  clapping her hands . </s>  " Should I be able to see these flowers ?  "   " Yes ,  "  said the student ,   " mind you think of it the next time you go out ,  no doubt you will see them ,  if you peep through the window . </s>  I did so to-day ,  and I saw a long yellow lily lying stretched out on the sofa . She was a court lady . </s>  "   " Can the flowers from the Botanical Gardens go to these balls ?  "  asked Ida . </s>  " It is such a distance !  "   " Oh yes ,  "  said the student ,   " whenever they like ,  for they can fly . </s>  Have you not seen those beautiful red ,  white ,  and yellow butterflies ,  that look like flowers ?  They were flowers once . </s>  They have flown off their stalks into the air ,  and flap their leaves as if they were little wings to make them fly . </s>  Then ,  if they behave well ,  they obtain permission to fly about during the day ,  instead of being obliged to sit still on their stems at home ,  and so in time their leaves become real wings . </s>  It may be ,  however ,  that the flowers in the Botanical Gardens have never been to the king ' s palace ,  and ,  therefore ,  they know nothing of the merry doings at night ,  which take place there . </s>  I will tell you what to do ,  and the botanical professor ,  who lives close by here ,  will be so surprised . </s>  You know him very well ,  do you not ?  Well ,  next time you go into his garden ,  you must tell one of the flowers that there is going to be a grand ball at the castle ,  then that flower will tell all the others ,  and they will fly away to the castle as soon as possible . </s>  And when the professor walks into his garden ,  there will not be a single flower left . </s>  How he will wonder what has become of them !  "   " But how can one flower tell another ?  Flowers cannot speak ?  "   " No ,  certainly not ,  "  replied the student ;   " but they can make signs . </s>  Have you not often seen that when the wind blows they nod at one another ,  and rustle all their green leaves ?  "   " Can the professor understand the signs ?  "  asked Ida . </s>  " Yes ,  to be sure he can . He went one morning into his garden ,  and saw a stinging nettle making signs with its leaves to a beautiful red carnation . </s>  It was saying ,   ' You are so pretty ,  I like you very much . </s>  '  But the professor did not approve of such nonsense ,  so he clapped his hands on the nettle to stop it . </s>  Then the leaves ,  which are its fingers ,  stung him so sharply that he has never ventured to touch a nettle since . "   " Oh how funny !  "  said Ida ,  and she laughed . </s>  " How can anyone put such notions into a child ' s head ?  "  said a tiresome lawyer ,  who had come to pay a visit ,  and sat on the sofa . </s>  He did not like the student ,  and would grumble when he saw him cutting out droll or amusing pictures . </s>  Sometimes it would be a man hanging on a gibbet and holding a heart in his hand as if he had been stealing hearts . </s>  Sometimes it was an old witch riding through the air on a broom and carrying her husband on her nose . </s>  But the lawyer did not like such jokes ,  and he would say as he had just said ,   " How can anyone put such nonsense into a child ' s head !  what absurd fancies there are !  "  But to little Ida ,  all these stories which the student told her about the flowers ,  seemed very droll ,  and she thought over them a great deal . </s>  The flowers did hang their heads ,  because they had been dancing all night ,  and were very tired ,  and most likely they were ill . </s>  Then she took them into the room where a number of toys lay on a pretty little table ,  and the whole of the table drawer besides was full of beautiful things . </s>  Her doll Sophy lay in the doll ' s bed asleep ,  and little Ida said to her ,   " You must really get up Sophy ,  and be content to lie in the drawer to-night ;  the poor flowers are ill ,  and they must lie in your bed ,  then perhaps they will get well again . </s>  "  So she took the doll out ,  who looked quite cross ,  and said not a single word ,  for she was angry at being turned out of her bed . </s>  Ida placed the flowers in the doll ' s bed ,  and drew the quilt over them . </s>  Then she told them to lie quite still and be good ,  while she made some tea for them ,  so that they might be quite well and able to get up the next morning . </s>  And she drew the curtains close round the little bed ,  so that the sun might not shine in their eyes .

" Tuk !  little Tuk !  "  said a voice . </s>  It was a very little person who spoke . He was dressed as a sailor ,  and looked small enough to be a middy ,  but he was not one .

"  The little boy said not a word ;  he was half pleased and half afraid . </s>  They entered a long gallery ,  where the boy had been before . The walls were resplendent with paintings ;  here stood statues and busts ,  all in a clear light as if it were day . </s>  But the grandest appeared when the door of a side room opened ;  the little boy could remember what beautiful things he had seen there ,  but to-night everything shone in its brightest colors . </s>  Here stood the figure of a beautiful woman ,  as beautifully sculptured as possible by one of the great masters . </s>  Her graceful limbs appeared to move ;  dolphins sprang at her feet ,  and immortality shone from her eyes . The world called her the Venus de '  Medici . </s>  By her side were statues ,  in which the spirit of life breathed in stone ;  figures of men ,  one of whom whetted his sword ,  and was named the Grinder ;  wrestling gladiators formed another group ,  the sword had been sharpened for them ,  and they strove for the goddess of beauty . </s>  The boy was dazzled by so much glitter ;  for the walls were gleaming with bright colors ,  all appeared living reality . </s>  As they passed from hall to hall ,  beauty everywhere showed itself ;  and as the Metal Pig went step by step from one picture to the other ,  the little boy could see it all plainly . </s>  One glory eclipsed another ;  yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy ' s memory ,  more especially because of the happy children it represented ,  for these the little boy had seen in daylight . </s>  Many pass this picture by with indifference ,  and yet it contains a treasure of poetic feeling ;  it represents Christ descending into Hades . </s>  They are not the lost whom the spectator sees ,  but the heathen of olden times . </s>  The Florentine ,  Angiolo Bronzino ,  painted this picture ;  most beautiful is the expression on the face of the two children ,  who appear to have full confidence that they shall reach heaven at last . </s>  They are embracing each other ,  and one little one stretches out his hand towards another who stands below him ,  and points to himself ,  as if he were saying ,   " I am going to heaven . </s>  "  The older people stand as if uncertain ,  yet hopeful ,  and they bow in humble adoration to the Lord Jesus . </s>  On this picture the boy ' s eyes rested longer than on any other :  the Metal Pig stood still before it . A low sigh was heard . </s>  Did it come from the picture or from the animal ?  The boy raised his hands towards the smiling children ,  and then the Pig ran off with him through the open vestibule . </s>  " Thank you ,  thank you ,  you beautiful animal ,  "  said the little boy ,  caressing the Metal Pig as it ran down the steps . </s>  " Thanks to yourself also ,  "  replied the Metal Pig ;   " I have helped you and you have helped me ,  for it is only when I have an innocent child on my back that I receive the power to run . </s>  Yes ;  as you see ,  I can even venture under the rays of the lamp ,  in front of the picture of the Madonna ,  but I may not enter the church ;  still from without ,  and while you are upon my back ,  I may look in through the open door . </s>  Do not get down yet ,  for if you do ,  then I shall be lifeless ,  as you have seen me in the Porta Rosa . </s>  "   " I will stay with you ,  my dear creature ,  "  said the little boy . </s>  So then they went on at a rapid pace through the streets of Florence ,  till they came to the square before the church of Santa Croce . </s>  The folding-doors flew open ,  and light streamed from the altar through the church into the deserted square . </s>  A wonderful blaze of light streamed from one of the monuments in the left-side aisle ,  and a thousand moving stars seemed to form a glory round it ;  even the coat-of-arms on the tomb-stone shone ,  and a red ladder on a blue field gleamed like fire . </s>  It was the grave of Galileo . </s>  The monument is unadorned ,  but the red ladder is an emblem of art ,  signifying that the way to glory leads up a shining ladder ,  on which the prophets of mind rise to heaven ,  like Elias of old . </s>  In the right aisle of the church every statue on the richly carved sarcophagi seemed endowed with life . </s>  Here stood Michael Angelo ;  there Dante ,  with the laurel wreath round his brow ;  Alfieri and Machiavelli ;  for here side by side rest the great men -- the pride of Italy . </s>  The church itself is very beautiful ,  even more beautiful than the marble cathedral at Florence ,  though not so large .

It was built entirely of porcelain ,  and very costly ,  but so delicate and brittle that whoever touched it was obliged to be careful . </s>  In the garden could be seen the most singular flowers ,  with pretty silver bells tied to them ,  which tinkled so that every one who passed could not help noticing the flowers . </s>  Indeed ,  everything in the emperor ' s garden was remarkable ,  and it extended so far that the gardener himself did not know where it ended . </s>  Those who travelled beyond its limits knew that there was a noble forest ,  with lofty trees ,  sloping down to the deep blue sea ,  and the great ships sailed under the shadow of its branches . </s>  In one of these trees lived a nightingale ,  who sang so beautifully that even the poor fishermen ,  who had so many other things to do ,  would stop and listen . </s>  Sometimes ,  when they went at night to spread their nets ,  they would hear her sing ,  and say ,   " Oh ,  is not that beautiful ?  "  But when they returned to their fishing ,  they forgot the bird until the next night . </s>  Then they would hear it again ,  and exclaim  " Oh ,  how beautiful is the nightingale ' s song !  "  Travellers from every country in the world came to the city of the emperor ,  which they admired very much ,  as well as the palace and gardens ;  but when they heard the nightingale ,  they all declared it to be the best of all . </s>  And the travellers ,  on their return home ,  related what they had seen ;  and learned men wrote books ,  containing descriptions of the town ,  the palace ,  and the gardens ;  but they did not forget the nightingale ,  which was really the greatest wonder . </s>  And those who could write poetry composed beautiful verses about the nightingale ,  who lived in a forest near the deep sea . </s>  The books travelled all over the world ,  and some of them came into the hands of the emperor ;  and he sat in his golden chair ,  and ,  as he read ,  he nodded his approval every moment ,  for it pleased him to find such a beautiful description of his city ,  his palace ,  and his gardens . </s>  But when he came to the words ,   " the nightingale is the most beautiful of all ,  "  he exclaimed ,   " What is this ?  I know nothing of any nightingale . </s>  Is there such a bird in my empire ?  and even in my garden ?  I have never heard of it . Something ,  it appears ,  may be learnt from books . </s>  "  Then he called one of his lords-in-waiting ,  who was so high-bred ,  that when any in an inferior rank to himself spoke to him ,  or asked him a question ,  he would answer ,   " Pooh ,  "  which means nothing . </s>  " There is a very wonderful bird mentioned here ,  called a nightingale ,  "  said the emperor ;   " they say it is the best thing in my large kingdom . </s>  Why have I not been told of it ?  "   " I have never heard the name ,  "  replied the cavalier ;   " she has not been presented at court . </s>  "   " It is my pleasure that she shall appear this evening . "  said the emperor ;   " the whole world knows what I possess better than I do myself . </s>  "   " I have never heard of her ,  "  said the cavalier ;   " yet I will endeavor to find her . </s>  "  But where was the nightingale to be found ?  The nobleman went up stairs and down ,  through halls and passages ;  yet none of those whom he met had heard of the bird . </s>  So he returned to the emperor ,  and said that it must be a fable ,  invented by those who had written the book . </s>  " Your imperial majesty ,  "  said he ,   " cannot believe everything contained in books ;  sometimes they are only fiction ,  or what is called the black art . </s>  "   " But the book in which I have read this account ,  "  said the emperor ,   " was sent to me by the great and mighty emperor of Japan ,  and therefore it cannot contain a falsehood . </s>  I will hear the nightingale ,  she must be here this evening ;  she has my highest favor ;  and if she does not come ,  the whole court shall be trampled upon after supper is ended . </s>  "   " Tsing-pe !  "  cried the lord-in-waiting ,  and again he ran up and down stairs ,  through all the halls and corridors ;  and half the court ran with him ,  for they did not like the idea of being trampled upon . </s>  There was a great inquiry about this wonderful nightingale ,  whom all the world knew ,  but who was unknown to the court . </s>  At last they met with a poor little girl in the kitchen ,  who said ,   " Oh ,  yes ,  I know the nightingale quite well ;  indeed ,  she can sing . </s>  Every evening I have permission to take home to my poor sick mother the scraps from the table ;  she lives down by the sea-shore ,  and as I come back I feel tired ,  and I sit down in the wood to rest ,  and listen to the nightingale ' s song . </s>  Then the tears come into my eyes ,  and it is just as if my mother kissed me . </s>  "   " Little maiden ,  "  said the lord-in-waiting ,   " I will obtain for you constant employment in the kitchen ,  and you shall have permission to see the emperor dine ,  if you will lead us to the nightingale ;  for she is invited for this evening to the palace . </s>  "  So she went into the wood where the nightingale sang ,  and half the court followed her .

" Beautiful ,  "  said the young courtier again . " Now I hear it ,  tinkling like little church bells . </s>  "   " No ,  those are frogs ,  "  said the little maiden ;   " but I think we shall soon hear her now :  "  and presently the nightingale began to sing . </s>  " Hark ,  hark !  there she is ,  "  said the girl ,   " and there she sits ,  "  she added ,  pointing to a little gray bird who was perched on a bough . </s>  " Is it possible ?  "  said the lord-in-waiting ,   " I never imagined it would be a little ,  plain ,  simple thing like that . </s>  She has certainly changed color at seeing so many grand people around her . </s>  "   " Little nightingale ,  "  cried the girl ,  raising her voice ,   " our most gracious emperor wishes you to sing before him . </s>  "   " With the greatest pleasure ,  "  said the nightingale ,  and began to sing most delightfully . </s>  " It sounds like tiny glass bells ,  "  said the lord-in-waiting ,   " and see how her little throat works . </s>  It is surprising that we have never heard this before ;  she will be a great success at court . </s>  "   " Shall I sing once more before the emperor ?  "  asked the nightingale ,  who thought he was present . </s>  " My excellent little nightingale ,  "  said the courtier ,   " I have the great pleasure of inviting you to a court festival this evening ,  where you will gain imperial favor by your charming song . </s>  "   " My song sounds best in the green wood ,  "  said the bird ;  but still she came willingly when she heard the emperor ' s wish . The palace was elegantly decorated for the occasion . </s>  The walls and floors of porcelain glittered in the light of a thousand lamps . </s>  Beautiful flowers ,  round which little bells were tied ,  stood in the corridors :  what with the running to and fro and the draught ,  these bells tinkled so loudly that no one could speak to be heard .

"  cried out his wife ,   " and can ' st thou thyself have the heart to take thy children out along with thee on purpose to lose them ?  "  In vain did her husband represent to her their extreme poverty ;  she would not consent to it ;  she was ,  indeed poor ,  but she was their mother . </s>  However ,  having considered what a grief it would be to her to see them perish with hunger ,  she at last consented and went to bed all in tears . </s>  Little Thumb heard every word that had been spoken ;  for observing ,  as he lay in his bed ,  that they were talking very busily ,  he had got up softly and hid himself under his father ' s stool ,  that he might hear what they said ,  without being seen . </s>  He went to bed again ,  but did not sleep a wink all the rest of the night ,  thinking on what he ought to do . </s>  He got up early in the morning ,  and went to the river side ,  where he filled his pockets full of small white pebbles ,  and then returned home . </s>  They all went abroad ,  but Little Thumb never told his brothers one syllable of what he knew . </s>  They went into a very thick forest ,  where they could not see one another at ten paces distance . The faggot-maker began to cut wood ,  and the children to gather up sticks to make faggots . </s>  Their father and mother seeing them busy at their work ,  got from them by degrees ,  and then ran away from them all at once ,  along a by-way ,  thro '  the winding bushes . </s>  When the children saw they were left alone ,  they began to cry as loud as they could . </s>  Little Thumb let them cry on ,  knowing very well how to go home again ;  for as he came he had taken care to drop all along the way the little white pebbles he had in his pockets . </s>  Then said he to them :   " Be not afraid ,  brothers ,  father and mother have left us here ,  but I will lead you home again ,  only follow me . </s>  "  They did so ,  and he brought them home by the very same way they came into the forest . </s>  They dared not to go in ,  but sat themselves down at the door ,  listening to what their father and mother were saying . </s>  The very moment the faggot-maker and his wife were got home ,  the lord of the manor sent them ten crowns ,  which he had owed them a long while ,  and which they never expected . </s>  This gave them new life ;  for the poor people were almost famished . The faggot-maker sent his wife immediately to the butcher ' s . </s>  As it was a long while since they had eaten a bit ,  she bought thrice as much meat as would sup two people . </s>  Having filled their bellies ,  the woman said :   " Alas !  where are now our poor children ?  They would make a good feast of what we have left here ;  but then it was you ,  William ,  who had a mind to lose them ;  I told you we should repent of it :  what are they now doing in the forest ?  Alas !  dear God ,  the wolves have ,  perhaps ,  already eaten them up :  thou art very inhuman thus to have lost thy children . </s>  "  The faggot-maker grew at last quite out of patience ,  for she repeated this above twenty times ,  that they should repent of it ,  and she was in the right of it for so saying . </s>  He threatened to beat her ,  if she did not hold her tongue . </s>  It was not that the faggot-maker was not ,  perhaps ,  more vexed than his wife ,  but that she teized him ,  and that he was of the humour of a great many others ,  who love wives who speak right ,  but think those very importunate who are always in the right . </s>  She was half drowned in tears ,  crying out :   " Alas !  where are now my children ,  my poor children ?  "  She spake this so very loud ,  that the children who were at the door ,  began to cry out all together :   " Here we are ,  here we are . </s>  "  She ran immediately to open the door ,  and said ,  hugging them :   " I am glad to see you ,  my dear children ;  you are very hungry and weary ;  and my poor Peter ,  thou art horribly bemired ;  come in and let me clean thee . </s>  "  Now ,  you must know ,  that Peter was her eldest son ,  whom she loved above all the rest ,  because he was somewhat carrotty ,  as she herself was . </s>  They sat down to supper ,  and ate with such a good appetite as pleased both father and mother ,  whom they acquainted how frightened they were in the forest ;  speaking almost always all together . </s>  The good folks were extremely glad to see their children once more at home ,  and this joy continued while the ten crowns lasted ;  but when the money was all gone ,  they fell again into their former uneasiness ,  and resolved to lose them again ;  and ,  that they might be the surer of doing it ,  to carry them at a much greater distance than before . </s>  They could not talk of this so secretly ,  but they were overheard by Little Thumb ,  who made account to get out of this difficulty as well as the former ;  but though he got up betimes in the morning ,  to go and pick up some little pebbles ,  he was disappointed ;  for he found the house-door double-locked ,  and was at a stand what to do . </s>  When their father had given each of them a piece of bread for their breakfast ,  he fancied he might make use of this bread instead of the pebbles ,  by throwing it in little bits all along the way they should pass ;  and so he put it up into his pocket . </s>  Their father and mother brought them into the thickest and most obscure part of the forest ;  when ,  stealing away into a by-path ,  they there left them . </s>  Little Thumb was not very uneasy at it ;  for he thought he could easily find the way again ,  by means of his bread which he had scattered all along as he came . </s>  But he was very much surprised when he could not find so much as one crumb ;  the birds had come and eaten it up every bit .

' Surely eggs take longer hatching than they did ,  '  she said to herself ;  and she pined for a little amusement also . </s>  Still ,  she knew that if she left her eggs and the ducklings in them to die none of her friends would ever speak to her again ;  so there she stayed ,  only getting off the eggs several times a day to see if the shells were cracking -- which may have been the very reason why they did not crack sooner . </s>  She had looked at the eggs at least a hundred and fifty times ,  when ,  to her joy ,  she saw a tiny crack on two of them ,  and scrambling back to the nest she drew the eggs closer the one to the other ,  and never moved for the whole of that day . </s>  Next morning she was rewarded by noticing cracks in the whole five eggs ,  and by midday two little yellow heads were poking out from the shells . </s>  This encouraged her so much that ,  after breaking the shells with her bill ,  so that the little creatures could get free of them ,  she sat steadily for a whole night upon the nest ,  and before the sun arose the five white eggs were empty ,  and ten pairs of eyes were gazing out upon the green world . </s>  Now the duck had been carefully brought up ,  and did not like dirt ,  and ,  besides ,  broken shells are not at all comfortable things to sit or walk upon ;  so she pushed the rest out over the side ,  and felt delighted to have some company to talk to till the big egg hatched . </s>  But day after day went on ,  and the big egg showed no signs of cracking ,  and the duck grew more and more impatient ,  and began to wish to consult her husband ,  who never came . </s>  ' I ca not think what is the matter with it ,  '  the duck grumbled to her neighbour who had called in to pay her a visit . </s>  ' Why I could have hatched two broods in the time that this one has taken !  '   ' Let me look at it ,  '  said the old neighbour . </s>  ' Ah ,  I thought so ;  it is a turkey ' s egg . </s>  Once ,  when I was young ,  they tricked me to sitting on a brood of turkey ' s eggs myself ,  and when they were hatched the creatures were so stupid that nothing would make them learn to swim . </s>  I have no patience when I think of it . </s>  '   ' Well ,  I will give it another chance ,  '  sighed the duck ,   ' and if it does not come out of its shell in another twenty-four hours ,  I will just leave it alone and teach the rest of them to swim properly and to find their own food . </s>  I really ca not be expected to do two things at once . '  And with a fluff of her feathers she pushed the egg into the middle of the nest . </s>  All through the next day she sat on ,  giving up even her morning bath for fear that a blast of cold might strike the big egg . </s>  In the evening ,  when she ventured to peep ,  she thought she saw a tiny crack in the upper part of the shell . </s>  Filled with hope ,  she went back to her duties ,  though she could hardly sleep all night for excitement . When she woke with the first steaks of light she felt something stirring under her . </s>  Yes ,  there it was at last ;  and as she moved ,  a big awkward bird tumbled head foremost on the ground . </s>  There was no denying it was ugly ,  even the mother was forced to admit that to herself ,  though she only said it was  ' large '  and  ' strong . </s>  '   ' You wo not need any teaching when you are once in the water ,  '  she told him ,  with a glance of surprise at the dull brown which covered his back ,  and at his long naked neck . </s>  And indeed he did not ,  though he was not half so pretty to look at as the little yellow balls that followed her . </s>  When they returned they found the old neighbour on the bank waiting for them to take them into the duckyard . </s>  ' No ,  it is not a young turkey ,  certainly ,  '  whispered she in confidence to the mother ,   ' for though it is lean and skinny ,  and has no colour to speak of ,  yet there is something rather distinguished about it ,  and it holds its head up well . </s>  '   ' It is very kind of you to say so ,  '  answered the mother ,  who by this time had some secret doubts of its loveliness . </s>  ' Of course ,  when you see it by itself it is all right ,  though it is different ,  somehow ,  from the others . </s>  But one cannot expect all one ' s children to be beautiful !  '  By this time they had reached the centre of the yard ,  where a very old duck was sitting ,  who was treated with great respect by all the fowls present . </s>  ' You must go up and bow low before her ,  '  whispered the mother to her children ,  nodding her head in the direction of the old lady ,   ' and keep your legs well apart ,  as you see me do . </s>  No well-bred duckling turns in its toes . It is a sign of common parents . </s>  '  The little ducks tried hard to make their small fat bodies copy the movements of their mother ,  and the old lady was quite pleased with them ;  but the rest of the ducks looked on discontentedly ,  and said to each other :   ' Oh ,  dear me ,  here are ever so many more !   The yard is full already ;  and did you ever see anything quite as ugly as that great tall creature ?   He is a disgrace to any brood . </s>  I shall go and chase him out !  '   So saying she put up her feathers ,  and running to the big duckling bit his neck . </s>  The duckling gave a loud quack ;  it was the first time he had felt any pain ,  and at the sound his mother turned quickly . </s>  ' Leave him alone ,  '  she said fiercely ,   ' or I will send for his father . He was not troubling you . </s>  '   ' No ;  but he is so ugly and awkward no one can put up with him ,  '  answered the stranger . </s>  And though the duckling did not understand the meaning of the words ,  he felt he was being blamed ,  and became more uncomfortable still when the old Spanish duck who ruled the fowlyard struck in :   ' It certainly is a great pity he is so different from these beautiful darlings .

But she was wrong ,  for it was only the beginning . </s>  Down ,  down ,  down went the girl -- it seemed as if the well must reach to the very middle of the earth ;  but at last her feet touched the ground ,  and she found herself in a field more beautiful than even the summer pastures of her native mountains . </s>  Trees waved in the soft breeze ,  and flowers of the brightest colours danced in the grass . </s>  And though she was quite alone ,  the girl ' s heart danced too ,  for she felt happier than she had since her father died . </s>  So she walked on through the meadow till she came to an old tumbledown fence -- so old that it was a wonder it managed to stand up at all ,  and it looked as if it depended for support on the old man ' s beard that climbed all over it . </s>  The girl paused for a moment as she came up ,  and gazed about for a place where she might safely cross . </s>  But before she could move a voice cried from the fence :   ' Do not hurt me ,  little maiden ;  I am so old ,  so old ,  I have not much longer to live . </s>  '  And the maiden answered :   ' No ,  I will not hurt you ;  fear nothing . </s>  '   And then seeing a spot where the clematis grew less thickly than in other places ,  she jumped lightly over . </s>  ' May all go well with thee ,  '  said the fence ,  as the girl walked on . She soon left the meadow and turned into a path which ran between two flowery hedges . </s>  Right in front of her stood an oven ,  and through its open door she could see a pile of white loaves . </s>  ' Eat as many loaves as you like ,  but do me no harm ,  little maiden ,  '  cried the oven . </s>  And the maiden told her to fear nothing ,  for she never hurt anything ,  and was very grateful for the oven ' s kindness in giving her such a beautiful white loaf . </s>  When she had finished it ,  down to the last crumb ,  she shut the oven door and said :   ' Good-morning . </s>  '   ' May all go well with thee ,  '  said the oven ,  as the girl walked on . </s>  By-and-by she became very thirsty ,  and seeing a cow with a milk-pail hanging on her horn ,  turned towards her . </s>  ' Milk me and drink as much as you will ,  little maiden ,  '  cried the cow ,   ' but be sure you spill none on the ground ;  and do me no harm ,  for I have never harmed anyone . </s>  '   ' Nor I ,  '  answered the girl ;   ' fear nothing . '   So she sat down and milked till the pail was nearly full . </s>  Then she drank it all up except a little drop at the bottom .

And she began combing out the old woman ' s hair ,  which was long and white . </s>  Half an hour passed in this way ,  and then the old woman said :   ' As you did not think yourself too good to comb me ,  I will show you where you may take service . </s>  Be prudent and patient and all will go well . </s>  '  So the girl thanked her ,  and set out for a farm at a little distance ,  where she was engaged to milk the cows and sift the corn . </s>  As soon as it was light next morning the girl got up and went into the cow-house .

'   ' My poor little pussies ,  '  said she ,   ' of course you shall have some . </s>  '  And she went into the dairy ,  followed by all the cats ,  and gave each one a little red saucerful . </s>  But before they drank they all rubbed themselves against her knees and purred by way of thanks . </s>  The next thing the girl had to do was to go to the storehouse ,  and to sift the corn through a sieve . </s>  While she was busy rubbing the corn she heard a whirr of wings ,  and a flock of sparrows flew in at the window . </s>  ' We are hungry ;  give us some corn !  give us some corn !

' Then lay the cloak on the ground at my feet ,  '  said the lion ,   ' and I will give my judgment . </s>  '   So the mantle was spread upon the red earth ,  the hyena and the jackal standing on each side of it . </s>  There was silence for a few moments ,  and then the lion sat up ,  looking very great and wise . </s>  ' My judgment is that the garment shall belong wholly to whoever first rings the bell of the nearest mosque at dawn to-morrow . </s>  Now go ;  for much business awaits me !  '  All that night the hyena sat up ,  fearing lest the jackal should reach the bell before him ,  for the mosque was close at hand . </s>  With the first streak of dawn he bounded away to the bell ,  just as the jackal ,  who had slept soundly all night ,  was rising to his feet . </s>  ' Good luck to you ,  '  cried the jackal . And throwing the cloak over his back he darted away across the plain ,  and was seen no more by his friend the hyena . </s>  After running several miles the jackal thought he was safe from pursuit ,  and seeing a lion and another hyena talking together ,  he strolled up to join them . </s>  ' Good morning ,  '  he said ;   amay I ask what is the matter ?   You seem very serious about something . '   ' Pray sit down ,  '  answered the lion . </s>  ' We were wondering in which direction we should go to find the best dinner . The hyena wishes to go to the forest ,  and I to the mountains . </s>  What do you say ?  '   ' Well ,  as I was sauntering over the plain ,  just now ,  I noticed a flock of sheep grazing ,  and some of them had wandered into a little valley quite out of sight of the shepherd . </s>  If you keep among the rocks you will never be observed . </s>  But perhaps you will allow me to go with you and show you the way ?  '   ' You are really very kind ,  '  answered the lion . </s>  And they crept steadily along till at length they reached the mouth of the valley where a ram ,  a sheep and a lamb were feeding on the rich grass ,  unconscious of their danger . </s>  ' How shall we divide them ?  '  asked the lion in a whisper to the hyena . ' Oh ,  it is easily done ,  '  replied the hyena . </s>  ' The lamb for me ,  the sheep for the jackal ,  and the ram for the lion . </s>  '   ' So I am to have that lean creature ,  which is nothing but horns ,  am I ?  '  cried the lion in a rage . </s>  ' I will teach you to divide things in that manner !  '  And he gave the hyena two great blows ,  which stretched him dead in a moment . </s>  Then he turned to the jackal and said :   ' How would you divide them ?  '   ' Quite differently from the hyena ,  '  replied the jackal . </s>  ' You will breakfast off the lamb ,  you will dine off the sheep ,  and you will sup off the ram . </s>  '   ' Dear me ,  how clever you are !   Who taught you such wisdom ?  '  exclaimed the lion ,  looking at him admiringly . </s>  ' The fate of the hyena ,  '  answered the jackal ,  laughing ,  and running off at his best speed ;  for he saw two men armed with spears coming close behind the lion !   The jackal continued to run till at last he could run no longer . </s>  He flung himself under a tree panting for breath ,  when he heard a rustle amongst the grass ,  and his father ' s old friend the hedgehog appeared before him . </s>  ' Oh ,  is it you ?  '  asked the little creature ;   ' how strange that we should meet so far from home !  '   ' I have just had a narrow escape of my life ,  '  gasped the jackal ,   ' and I need some sleep . </s>  After that we must think of something to do to amuse ourselves . '   And he lay down again and slept soundly for a couple of hours . </s>  ' Now I am ready ,  '  said he ;   ' have you anything to propose ?  '   ' In a valley beyond those trees ,  '  answered the hedgehog ,   ' there is a small farmhouse where the best butter in the world is made . </s>  I know their ways ,  and in an hour ' s time the farmer ' s wife will be off to milk the cows ,  which she keeps at some distance . </s>  We could easily get in at the window of the shed where she keeps the butter ,  and I will watch ,  lest some one should come unexpectedly ,  while you have a good meal . </s>  Then you shall watch ,  and I will eat . '   ' That sounds a good plan ,  '  replied the jackal ;  and they set off together . </s>  But when they reached the farmhouse the jackal said to the hedgehog :   ' Go in and fetch the pots of butter and I will hide them in a safe place . </s>  '   ' Oh no ,  '  cried the hedgehog ,   ' I really could not . They would find out directly !   And ,  besides ,  it is so different just eating a little now and then . </s>  '   ' Do as I bid you at once ,  '  said the jackal ,  looking at the hedgehog so sternly that the little fellow dared say no more ,  and soon rolled the jars to the window where the jackal lifted them out one by one . </s>  When they were all in a row before him he gave a sudden start . </s>  ' Run for your life ,  '  he whispered to his companion ;   ' I see the woman coming over the hill !  '  And the hedgehog ,  his heart beating ,  set off as fast as he could . </s>  The jackal remained where he was ,  shaking with laughter ,  for the woman was not in sight at all ,  and he had only sent the hedgehog away because he did not want him to know where the jars of butter were buried . </s>  But every day he stole out to their hiding-place and had a delicious feast . </s>  At length ,  one morning ,  the hedgehog suddenly said :   ' You never told me what you did with those jars ?  '   ' Oh ,  I hid them safely till the farm people should have forgotten all about them ,  '  replied the jackal . </s>  ' But as they are still searching for them we must wait a little longer ,  and then I will bring them home ,  and we will share them between us . </s>  '  So the hedgehog waited and waited ;  but every time he asked if there was no chance of getting jars of butter the jackal put him off with some excuse . </s>  After a while the hedgehog became suspicious ,  and said :   ' I should like to know where you have hidden them . To-night ,  when it is quite dark ,  you shall show me the place . </s>

I do wish I had never come away !

' And there is no reason that you should not hunt too . </s>  '  All the faces brightened at that ,  for ,  to tell the truth ,  they were nearly as dull as their mistress ;  so the queen had her way ,  and two beautiful horses were brought from the stable to draw the little chariot . </s>  At first the queen took care to keep near the rest of the hunt ,  but gradually she stayed away longer and longer ,  and at last ,  one morning ,  she took advantage of the appearance of a wild boar ,  after which her whole court instantly galloped ,  to turn into a path in the opposite direction . </s>  Unluckily ,  it did not happen to lead towards the king ' s palace ,  where she intended to go ,  but she was so afraid her flight would be noticed that she whipped up her horses till they ran away . </s>  When she understood what was happening the poor young queen was terribly frightened ,  and ,  dropping the reins ,  clung to the side of the chariot . </s>  The horses ,  thus left without any control ,  dashed blindly against a tree ,  and the queen was flung out on the ground ,  where she lay for some minutes unconscious . </s>  A rustling sound near her at length caused her to open her eyes ;  before her stood a huge woman ,  almost a giantess ,  without any clothes save a lion ' s skin ,  which was thrown over her shoulders ,  while a dried snake ' s skin was plaited into her hair . </s>  In one hand she held a club on which she leaned ,  and in the other a quiver full of arrows . </s>  At the sight of this strange figure the queen thought she must be dead ,  and gazing on an inhabitant of another world . </s>  So she murmured softly to herself :   ' I am not surprised that people are so loth to die when they know that they will see such horrible creatures . </s>  '   But ,  low as she spoke ,  the giantess caught the words ,  and began to laugh . </s>  ' Oh ,  do not be afraid ;  you are still alive ,  and perhaps ,  after all ,  you may be sorry for it . </s>  I am the Lion Fairy ,  and you are going to spend the rest of your days with me in my palace ,  which is quite near this .

' I am rich enough already ,  '  she answered ,   ' but I am often dull ,  and I think you may amuse me a little . </s>  '   And ,  so saying ,  she changed her shape into that of a lion ,  and throwing the queen across her back ,  she went down the ten thousand steps that led to her palace . </s>  The lion had reached the centre of the earth before she stopped in front of a house ,  lighted with lamps ,  and built on the edge of a lake of quicksilver . </s>  In this lake various huge monsters might be seen playing or fighting -- the queen did not know which --  and around flew rooks and ravens ,  uttering dismal croaks . </s>  In the distance was a mountain down whose sides waters slowly coursed -- these were the tears of unhappy lovers -- and nearer the gate were trees without either fruit of flowers ,  while nettles and brambles covered the ground . </s>  If the castle had been gloomy ,  what did the queen feel about this ?

' Yes ,  it was . </s>  And worse than that ,  the crested lark ,  that was formerly so timid and shy ,  is now no better than a thief ,  and steals maize and corn whenever she can find them . </s>  '   ' I am astonished at what you say . </s>  '   ' You will be more astonished when I tell you that on my arrival here for the summer I found my nest occupied by a shameless sparrow !

The winter was long and cold ,  and the thoughts of the villagers were much busier with wolves than with Andras Baive ,  when suddenly ,  on a frosty day ,  he made his appearance in the little town of Vadso . </s>  The bailiff was delighted at this chance of trying his strength ,  and at once went out to seek Andras and to coax him into giving proof of his vigour . </s>  As he walked along his eyes fell upon a big eight-oared boat that lay upon the shore ,  and his face shone with pleasure . </s>  ' That is the very thing ,  '  laughed he ,   ' I will make him jump over that boat . </s>  '  Andras was quite ready to accept the challenge ,  and they soon settled the terms of the wager . </s>  He who could jump over the boat without so much as touching it with his heel was to be the winner ,  and would get a large sum of money as the prize . </s>  So ,  followed by many of the villagers ,  the two men walked down to the sea . </s>  An old fisherman was chosen to stand near the boat to watch fair play ,  and to hold the stakes ,  and Andras ,  as the stranger was told to jump first . </s>  Going back to the flag which had been stuck into the sand to mark the starting place ,  he ran forward ,  with his head well thrown back ,  and cleared the boat with a mighty bound . </s>  The lookers- on cheered him ,  and indeed he well deserve it ;  but they waited anxiously all the same to see what the bailiff would do . </s>  On he came ,  taller than Andras by several inches ,  but heavier of build . He too sprang high and well ,  but as he came down his heel just grazed the edge of the boat . </s>  Dead silence reigned amidst the townsfolk ,  but Andras only laughed and said carelessly :   ' Just a little too short ,  bailiff ;  next time you must do better than that . </s>  '  The bailiff turned red with anger at his rival ' s scornful words ,  and answered quickly :   ' Next time you will have something harder to do . </s>  '  And turning his back on his friends ,  he went sulkily home . Andras ,  putting the money he had earned in his pocket ,  went home also . </s>  The following spring Andras happened to be driving his reindeer along a great fiord to the west of Vadso . </s>  A boy who had met him hastened to tell the bailiff that his enemy was only a few miles off ;  and the bailiff ,  disguising himself as a Stalo ,  or ogre ,  called his son and his dog and rowed away across the fiord to the place where the boy had met Andras . </s>  Now the mountaineer was lazily walking along the sands ,  thinking of the new hut that he was building with the money that he had won on the day of his lucky jump . </s>  He wandered on ,  his eyes fixed on the sands ,  so that he did not see the bailiff drive his boat behind a rock ,  while he changed himself into a heap of wreckage which floated in on the waves . </s>  A stumble over a stone recalled Andras to himself ,  and looking up he beheld the mass of wreckage . </s>  ' Dear me !   I may find some use for that ,  '  he said ;  and hastened down to the sea ,  waiting till he could lay hold of some stray rope which might float towards him . </s>  Suddenly -- he could not have told why -- a nameless fear seized upon him ,  and he fled away from the shore as if for his life . </s>  As he ran he heard the sound of a pipe ,  such as only ogres of the Stalo kind were wont to use ;  and there flashed into his mind what the bailiff had said when they jumped the boat :   ' Next time you will have something harder to do . </s>  '   So it was no wreckage after all that he had seen ,  but the bailiff himself . </s>  It happened that in the long summer nights up in the mountain ,  where the sun never set ,  and it was very difficult to get to sleep ,  Andras had spent many hours in the study of magic ,  and this stood him in good stead now . </s>  The instant he heard the Stalo music he wished himself to become the feet of a reindeer ,  and in this guise he galloped like the wind for several miles . </s>  Then he stopped to take breath and find out what his enemy was doing . </s>  Nothing he could see ,  but to his ears the notes of a pipe floated over the plain ,  and ever ,  as he listened ,  it drew nearer . </s>  A cold shiver shook Andras ,  and this time he wished himself the feet of a reindeer calf . </s>  For when a reindeer calf has reached the age at which he begins first to lose his hair he is so swift that neither beast nor bird can come near him . </s>  A reindeer calf is the swiftest of all things living . </s>  Yes ;  but not so swift as a Stalo ,  as Andras found out when he stopped to rest ,  and heard the pipe playing !  For a moment his heart sank ,  and he gave himself up for dead ,  till he remembered that ,  not far off ,  were two little lakes joined together by a short though very broad river . </s>  In the middle of the river lay a stone that was always covered by water ,  except in dry seasons ,  and as the winter rains had been very heavy ,  he felt quite sure that not even the top of it could be seen . </s>  The next minute ,  if anyone had been looking that way ,  he would have beheld a small reindeer calf speeding northwards ,  and by-and-by giving a great spring ,  which landed him in the midst of the stream . </s>  But ,  instead of sinking to the bottom ,  he paused a second to steady himself ,  then gave a second spring which landed him on the further shore . </s>  He next ran on to a little hill where he saw down and began to neigh loudly ,  so that the Stalo might know exactly where he was . </s>  ' Ah !   There you are ,  '  cried the Stalo ,  appearing on the opposite bank ;   ' for a moment I really thought I had lost you . </s>  '   ' No such luck ,  '  answered Andras ,  shaking his head sorrowfully . By this time he had taken his own shape again . </s>  ' Well ,  but I do not see how I am to get to you1 '  said the Stalo ,  looking up and down . </s>  ' Jump over ,  as I did ,  '  answered Andras ;   ' it is quite easy . </s>  '   ' But I could not jump this river ;  and I do not know how you did ,  '  replied the Stalo . ' I should be ashamed to say such things ,  '  exclaimed Andras . </s>  ' Do you mean to tell me that a jump ,  which the weakest Lapp boy would make nothing of ,  is beyond your strength ?  '  The Stalo grew red and angry when he heard these words ,  just as Andras meant him to do . </s>  He bounded into the air and fell straight into the river . </s>  Not that that would have mattered ,  for he was a good swimmer ;  but Andras drew out the bow and arrows which every Lapp carries ,  and took aim at him . </s>  His aim was good ,  but the Stalo sprang so high into the air that the arrow flew between his feet . </s>  A second shot ,  directed at his forehead ,  fared no better ,  for this time the Stalo jumped so high to the other side that the arrow passed between his finger and thumb . </s>  Then Andras aimed his third arrow a little over the Stalo ' s head ,  and when he sprang up ,  just an instant too soon ,  it hit him between the ribs .

Then Setanta concealed his desire ,  but enquired narrowly concerning the partings of the roads on the way to Emania . </s>  At last ,  when he was ten years old ,  selecting a favourable night ,  Setanta stole away from his father ' s Dun ,  and before morning had crossed the frontier . </s>  He then lay down to rest and sleep in a wood .

After this the boys came together into a group and held a council . </s>  Then commenced what seemed to be an attempt to force him out of the ground ,  followed by a furious fight . </s>  The strange boy seemed to be a very demon of war ;  with his little hurle grasped ,  like a war-mace ,  in both hands ,  he laid about him on every side ,  and the boys were tumbling fast . </s>  He sprang at tall youths ,  like a hound at a stag ' s throat .

"  Then sat she down and said to me ,   " O my sister ,  I have a brother who hath had sight of thee at sundry wedding feasts and festive seasons :  he is a youth handsomer than I ,  and he hath fallen desperately in love with thee ,  for that bounteous Destiny hath garnered in thee all beauty and perfection ;  and he hath given silver to this old woman that she might visit thee ;  and she hath contrived on this wise to foregather us twain . </s>  He hath heard that thou art one of the nobles of thy tribe nor is he aught less in his ;  and ,  being desirous to ally his lot with thy lot ,  he hath practiced this device to bring me in company with thee ;  for he is fain to marry thee after the ordinance of Allah and his Apostle ;  and in what is lawful and right there is no shame . </s>  "  When I heard these words and saw myself fairly entrapped in the house ,  I said ,   " Hearing is consenting . </s>  "  She was delighted at this and clapped her hands ;  whereupon a door opened and out of it came a young man blooming in the prime of life ,  exquisitely dressed ,  a model of beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace ,  with gentle winning manners and eyebrows like a bended bow and shaft on cord ,  and eyes which bewitched all hearts with sorcery lawful in the sight of the Lord ;  even as saith some rhymer describing the like of him :  --  His face as the face of the young moon shines  And Fortune      stamps him with pearls for signs .

"   There dwelt during times of yore ,  and years and ages long gone before ,  in a certain city of China ,  a Tailor who was an open handed man that loved pleasuring and merry making ;  and who was wont ,  he and his wife ,  to solace themselves from time to time with public diversions and amusements . </s>  One day they went out with the first of the light and were returning in the evening when they fell in with a Hunchback ,  whose semblance would draw a laugh from care and dispel the horrors of despair . </s>  So they went up to enjoy looking at him and invited him to go home with them and converse and carouse with them that night . </s>  He consented and accompanied them afoot to their home ;  whereupon the Tailor fared forth to the bazaar  ( night having just set in )  and bought a fried fish and bread and lemons and dry sweetmeats for dessert ;  and set the victuals before the Hunchback and they ate . </s>  Presently the Tailor ' s wife took a great fid of fish and gave it in a gobbet to the Gobbo ,  stopping his mouth with her hand and saying ,   " By Allah ,  thou must down with it at a single gulp ;  and I will not give thee time to chew it . </s>  "  So he bolted it ;  but therein was a stiff bone which stuck in his gullet and ,  his hour being come ,  he died . </s>  -- And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say . </s>  When it was the Twenty-fifth Night ,  She said ,  It hath reached me ,  O auspicious King ,  that when the Tailor ' s wife gave the Hunchback that mouthful of fish which ended his term of days he died on the instant . </s>  Seeing this the Tailor cried aloud ,   " There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah !  Alas ,  that this poor wretch should have died in so foolish fashion at our hands !  "  and the woman rejoined ,   " Why this idle talk ?  Hast thou not heard his saying who said :  --  Why then waste I my time in grief ,  until I  find no friend to      bear my weight of woe How sleep upon a fire that flames unquenched ?   Upon the flames      to rest were hard enow !  "  Asked her husband ,   " And what shall I do with him ?  "  ;  and she answered ,   " Rise and take him in thine arms and spread a silken kerchief over him ;  then I will fare forth ,  with thee following me this very night and if thou meet any one say ,   ' This is my son ,  and his mother and I are carrying him to the doctor that he may look at him . </s>  '  "  So he rose and taking the Hunchback in his arms bore him along the streets ,  preceded by his wife who kept crying ,   " O my son ,  Allah keep thee !  what part paineth thee and where hath this small-pox attacked thee ?  "  So all who saw them said  "  ' Tis a child sick of small-pox . </s>  "   They went along asking for the physician ' s house till folk directed them to that of a leach which was a Jew . </s>  They knocked at the door ,  and there came down to them a black slave girl who opened and ,  seeing a man bearing a babe ,  and a woman with him ,  said to them ,   " What is the matter ?  "   " We have a little one with us ,  "  answered the Tailor ' s wife ,   " and we wish to show him to the physician :  so take this quarter dinar and give it to thy master and let him come down and see my son who is sore sick . </s>  "  The girl went up to tell her master ,  whereupon the Tailor ' s wife walked into the vestibule and said to her husband ,   " Leave the Hunchback here and let us fly for our lives . </s>  "  So the Tailor carried the dead man to the top of the stairs and propped him upright against the wall and ran away ,  he and his wife . </s>  Meanwhile the girl went in to the Jew and said to him ,   " At the door are a man and a woman with a sick child and they have given me a quarter dinar for thee ,  that thou mayest go down and look at the little one and prescribe for it . </s>  "  As soon as the Jew saw the quarter dinar he rejoiced and rose quickly in his greed of gain and went forth hurriedly in the dark ;  but hardly had he made a step when he stumbled on the corpse and threw it over ,  when it rolled to the bottom of the staircase . </s>  So he cried out to the girl to hurry up with the light ,  and she brought it ,  whereupon he went down and examining the Hunchback found that he was stone dead . </s>  So he cried out ,   " O for Esdras !  O for Moses !  O for Aaron !  O for Joshua ,  son of Nun !  O the Ten Commandments !  I have stumbled against the sick one and he hath fallen downstairs and he is dead !  How shall I get this man I have killed out of my house ?  O by the hoofs of the ass of Esdras !  "  Then he took up the body and ,  carrying it into the house ,  told his wife what had happened and she said to him ,   " Why dost thou sit still ?  If thou keep him here till day break we shall both lose our lives . </s>  Let us two carry him to the terrace roof and throw him over into the house of our neighbour ,  the Moslem ,  for if he abide there a night the dogs will come down on him from the adjoining terraces and eat him up . </s>  "  Now his neighbour was a Reeve ,  the controller of the Sultan ' s kitchen ,  and was wont to bring back great store of oil and fat and broken meats ;  but the cats and rats used to eat it ,  or ,  if the dogs scented a fat sheep ' s tail they would come down from the nearest roofs and tear at it ;  and on this wise the beasts had already damaged much of what he brought home . </s>  So the Jew and his wife carried the Hunchback up to the roof ;  and ,  letting him down by his hands and feet through the wind-shaft into the Reeve ' s house ,  propped him up against the wall and went their ways . </s>  Hardly had they done this when the Reeve ,  who had been passing an evening with his friends hearing a recitation of the Koran ,  came home and opened the door and ,  going up with a lighted candle ,  found a son of Adam standing in the corner under the ventilator . </s>  When he saw this ,  he said ,   " Wah !  by Allah ,  very good forsooth !  He who robbeth my stuff is none other than a man . </s>  "  Then he turned to the Hunchback and said ,   " So  ' tis thou that stealest the meat and the fat !  I thought it was the cats and dogs ,  and I kill the dogs and cats of the quarter and sin against them by killing them . </s>  And all the while  ' tis thou comest down from the house terrace through the wind shaft . </s>  But I will avenge myself upon thee with my own hand !  "  So he snatched up a heavy hammer and set upon him and smote him full on the breast and he fell down . </s>  Then he examined him and ,  finding that he was dead ,  cried out in horror ,  thinking that he had killed him ,  and said ,   " There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah ,  the Glorious ,  the Great !  "  And he feared for his life ,  and added  " Allah curse the oil and the meat and the grease and the sheep ' s tails to boot !  How hath fate given this man his quietus at my hand !  "  Then he looked at the body and seeing it was that of a Gobbo ,  said ,   " Was it not enough for thee to be a hunchback ,  but thou must likewise be a thief and prig flesh and fat !  O thou Veiler ,  deign to veil me with Thy curtain of concealment !  "  So he took him up on his shoulders and ,  going forth with him from his house about the latter end of the night ,  carried him to the nearest end of the bazaar ,  where he set him up on his feet against the wall of a shop at the head of a dark lane ,  and left him and went away .

Long ,  long ago there lived ,  in Japan a brave warrior known to all as Tawara Toda ,  or  " My Lord Bag of Rice . </s>  "  His true name was Fujiwara Hidesato ,  and there is a very interesting story of how he came to change his name . </s>  One day he sallied forth in search of adventures ,  for he had the nature of a warrior and could not bear to be idle . </s>  So he buckled on his two swords ,  took his huge bow ,  much taller than himself ,  in his hand ,  and slinging his quiver on his back started out . </s>  He had not gone far when he came to the bridge of Seta-no-Karashi spanning one end of the beautiful Lake Biwa . </s>  No sooner had he set foot on the bridge than he saw lying right across his path a huge serpent-dragon . </s>  Its body was so big that it looked like the trunk of a large pine tree and it took up the whole width of the bridge . </s>  One of its huge claws rested on the parapet of one side of the bridge ,  while its tail lay right against the other . </s>  The monster seemed to be asleep ,  and as it breathed ,  fire and smoke came out of its nostrils . </s>  At first Hidesato could not help feeling alarmed at the sight of this horrible reptile lying in his path ,  for he must either turn back or walk right over its body . </s>  He was a brave man ,  however ,  and putting aside all fear went forward dauntlessly . </s>  Crunch ,  crunch !  he stepped now on the dragon ' s body ,  now between its coils ,  and without even one glance backward he went on his way . </s>  He had only gone a few steps when he heard some one calling him from behind . </s>  On turning back he was much surprised to see that the monster dragon had entirely disappeared and in its place was a strange-looking man ,  who was bowing most ceremoniously to the ground . </s>  His red hair streamed over his shoulders and was surmounted by a crown in the shape of a dragon ' s head ,  and his sea-green dress was patterned with shells . </s>  Hidesato knew at once that this was no ordinary mortal and he wondered much at the strange occurrence . </s>  Where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time ?  Or had it transformed itself into this man ,  and what did the whole thing mean ?  While these thoughts passed through his mind he had come up to the man on the bridge and now addressed him :   " Was it you that called me just now ?  "   " Yes ,  it was I ,  "  answered the man :   " I have an earnest request to make to you . </s>  Do you think you can grant it to me ?  "   " If it is in my power to do so I will ,  "  answered Hidesato ,   " but first tell me who you are ?  "   " I am the Dragon King of the Lake ,  and my home is in these waters just under this bridge . </s>  "   " And what is it you have to ask of me ?  "  said Hidesato . </s>  " I want you to kill my mortal enemy the centipede ,  who lives on the mountain beyond ,  "  and the Dragon King pointed to a high peak on the opposite shore of the lake . </s>  " I have lived now for many years in this lake and I have a large family of children and grand-children . </s>  For some time past we have lived in terror ,  for a monster centipede has discovered our home ,  and night after night it comes and carries off one of my family . </s>  I am powerless to save them . If it goes on much longer like this ,  not only shall I lose all my children ,  but I myself must fall a victim to the monster . </s>  I am ,  therefore ,  very unhappy ,  and in my extremity I determined to ask the help of a human being . </s>  For many days with this intention I have waited on the bridge in the shape of the horrible serpent-dragon that you saw ,  in the hope that some strong brave man would come along . </s>  But all who came this way ,  as soon as they saw me were terrified and ran away as fast as they could . </s>  You are the first man I have found able to look at me without fear ,  so I knew at once that you were a man of great courage . </s>  I beg you to have pity upon me . </s>  Will you not help me and kill my enemy the centipede ?  "  Hidesato felt very sorry for the Dragon King on hearing his story ,  and readily promised to do what he could to help him . </s>  The warrior asked where the centipede lived ,  so that he might attack the creature at once . </s>  The Dragon King replied that its home was on the mountain Mikami ,  but that as it came every night at a certain hour to the palace of the lake ,  it would be better to wait till then . </s>  So Hidesato was conducted to the palace of the Dragon King ,  under the bridge . </s>  Strange to say ,  as he followed his host downwards the waters parted to let them pass ,  and his clothes did not even feel damp as he passed through the flood . </s>  Never had Hidesato seen anything so beautiful as this palace built of white marble beneath the lake . </s>  He had often heard of the Sea King ' s palace at the bottom of the sea ,  where all the servants and retainers were salt-water fishes ,  but here was a magnificent building in the heart of Lake Biwa . </s>  The dainty goldfishes ,  red carp ,  and silvery trout ,  waited upon the Dragon King and his guest . Hidesato was astonished at the feast that was spread for him . </s>  The dishes were crystallized lotus leaves and flowers ,  and the chopsticks were of the rarest ebony . </s>  As soon as they sat down ,  the sliding doors opened and ten lovely goldfish dancers came out ,  and behind them followed ten red-carp musicians with the koto and the samisen . </s>  Thus the hours flew by till midnight ,  and the beautiful music and dancing had banished all thoughts of the centipede . </s>  The Dragon King was about to pledge the warrior in a fresh cup of wine when the palace was suddenly shaken by a tramp ,  tramp !  as if a mighty army had begun to march not far away . </s>  Hidesato and his host both rose to their feet and rushed to the balcony ,  and the warrior saw on the opposite mountain two great balls of glowing fire coming nearer and nearer . </s>  The Dragon King stood by the warrior ' s side trembling with fear . " The centipede !  The centipede !  Those two balls of fire are its eyes . </s>  It is coming for its prey !  Now is the time to kill it . </s>  "  Hidesato looked where his host pointed ,  and ,  in the dim light of the starlit evening ,  behind the two balls of fire he saw the long body of an enormous centipede winding round the mountains ,  and the light in its hundred feet glowed like so many distant lanterns moving slowly towards the shore . </s>  Hidesato showed not the least sign of fear . He tried to calm the Dragon King . " Do not be afraid . I shall surely kill the centipede . Just bring me my bow and arrows . </s>  "  The Dragon King did as he was bid ,  and the warrior noticed that he had only three arrows left in his quiver . </s>  He took the bow ,  and fitting an arrow to the notch ,  took careful aim and let fly . </s>  The arrow hit the centipede right in the middle of its head ,  but instead of penetrating ,  it glanced off harmless and fell to the ground . </s>  Nothing daunted ,  Hidesato took another arrow ,  fitted it to the notch of the bow and let fly . </s>  Again the arrow hit the mark ,  it struck the centipede right in the middle of its head ,  only to glance off and fall to the ground . </s>  The centipede was invulnerable to weapons !  When the Dragon King saw that even this brave warrior ' s arrows were powerless to kill the centipede ,  he lost heart and began to tremble with fear . </s>  The warrior saw that he had now only one arrow left in his quiver ,  and if this one failed he could not kill the centipede .

"  Then Princess Moonlight replied that there was nothing she would not do for him ,  that she honored and loved him as her own father ,  and that as for herself she could not remember the time before she came to earth .

Will you try hunting in the mountains and I will go and fish in the sea ?  "  The Skillful Fisher listened in silence to his brother ,  and for a moment was thoughtful ,  but at last he answered :   " O yes ,  why not ?  Your idea is not a bad one at all . </s>  Give me your bow and arrow and I will set out at once for the mountains and hunt for game . </s>  "  So the matter was settled by this talk ,  and the two brothers each started out to try the other ' s occupation ,  little dreaming of all that would happen . </s>  It was very unwise of them ,  for the Happy Hunter knew nothing of fishing ,  and the Skillful Fisher ,  who was bad tempered ,  knew as much about hunting . </s>  The Happy Hunter took his brother ' s much-prized fishing hook and rod and went down to the seashore and sat down on the rocks . He baited his hook and then threw it into the sea clumsily . </s>  He sat and gazed at the little float bobbing up and down in the water ,  and longed for a good fish to come and be caught . </s>  Every time the buoy moved a little he pulled up his rod ,  but there was never a fish at the end of it ,  only the hook and the bait . </s>  If he had known how to fish properly ,  he would have been able to catch plenty of fish ,  but although he was the greatest hunter in the land he could not help being the most bungling fisher . </s>  The whole day passed in this way ,  while he sat on the rocks holding the fishing rod and waiting in vain for his luck to turn . </s>  At last the day began to darken ,  and the evening came ;  still he had caught not a single fish . </s>  Drawing up his line for the last time before going home ,  he found that he had lost his hook without even knowing when he had dropped it . </s>  He now began to feel extremely anxious ,  for he knew that his brother would be angry at his having lost his hook ,  for ,  it being his only one ,  he valued it above all other things . </s>  The Happy Hunter now set to work to look among the rocks and on the sand for the lost hook ,  and while he was searching to and fro ,  his brother ,  the Skillful Fisher ,  arrived on the scene . </s>  He had failed to find any game while hunting that day ,  and was not only in a bad temper ,  but looked fearfully cross . </s>  When he saw the Happy Hunter searching about on the shore he knew that something must have gone wrong ,  so he said at once :   " What are you doing ,  my brother ?  "  The Happy Hunter went forward timidly ,  for he feared his brother ' s anger ,  and said :   " Oh ,  my brother ,  I have indeed done badly . </s>  "   " What is the matter ?  -- what have you done ?  "  asked the elder brother impatiently . </s>  " I have lost your precious fishing hook --  "  While he was still speaking his brother stopped him ,  and cried out fiercely :   " Lost my hook !  It is just what I expected . </s>  For this reason ,  when you first proposed your plan of changing over our occupations I was really against it ,  but you seemed to wish it so much that I gave in and allowed you to do as you wished . </s>  The mistake of our trying unfamiliar tasks is soon seen !  And you have done badly . I will not return you your bow and arrow till you have found my hook . </s>  Look to it that you find it and return it to me quickly . </s>  "  The Happy Hunter felt that he was to blame for all that had come to pass ,  and bore his brother ' s scornful scolding with humility and patience . </s>  He hunted everywhere for the hook most diligently ,  but it was nowhere to be found . He was at last obliged to give up all hope of finding it . </s>  He then went home ,  and in desperation broke his beloved sword into pieces and made five hundred hooks out of it . </s>  He took these to his angry brother and offered them to him ,  asking his forgiveness ,  and begging him to accept them in the place of the one he had lost for him . </s>  It was useless ;  his brother would not listen to him ,  much less grant his request . </s>  The Happy Hunter then made another five hundred hooks ,  and again took them to his brother ,  beseeching him to pardon him . </s>  " Though you make a million hooks ,  "  said the Skillful Fisher ,  shaking his head ,   " they are of no use to me . </s>  I cannot forgive you unless you bring me back my own hook . </s>  "  Nothing would appease the anger of the Skillful Fisher ,  for he had a bad disposition ,  and had always hated his brother because of his virtues ,  and now with the excuse of the lost fishing hook he planned to kill him and to usurp his place as ruler of Japan . </s>  The Happy Hunter knew all this full well ,  but he could say nothing ,  for being the younger he owed his elder brother obedience ;  so he returned to the seashore and once more began to look for the missing hook . </s>  He was much cast down ,  for he had lost all hope of ever finding his brother ' s hook now . </s>  While he stood on the beach ,  lost in perplexity and wondering what he had best do next ,  an old man suddenly appeared carrying a stick in his hand . </s>  The Happy Hunter afterwards remembered that he did not see from whence the old man came ,  neither did he know how he was there -- he happened to look up and saw the old man coming towards him . </s>  " You are Hohodemi ,  the Augustness ,  sometimes called the Happy Hunter ,  are you not ?  "  asked the old man . </s>  " What are you doing alone in such a place ?  "   " Yes ,  I am he ,  "  answered the unhappy young man . " Unfortunately ,  while fishing I lost my brother ' s precious fishing hook . </s>  I have hunted this shore all over ,  but alas !  I cannot find it ,  and I am very troubled ,  for my brother wo not forgive me till I restore it to him . </s>  But who are you ?  "   " My name is Shiwozuchino Okina ,  and I live near by on this shore . I am sorry to hear what misfortune has befallen you . You must indeed be anxious . </s>  But if I tell you what I think ,  the hook is nowhere here -- it is either at the bottom of the sea or in the body of some fish who has swallowed it ,  and for this reason ,  though you spend your whole life in looking for it here ,  you will never find it . </s>  "   " Then what can I do ?  "  asked the distressed man .

Our feathers are as soft and beautiful as your own shaggy hair . </s>  They will guard you from the cold winds and warm you while you sleep . </s>  Have courage ,  then ,  and live !  "  And the King of the Polar Bears had courage to bear his pain and lived and was strong again . </s>  The feathers grew as they had grown upon the bodies of the birds and covered him as his own hair had done . </s>  Mostly they were pure white in color ,  but some from the gray gulls gave his majesty a slight mottled appearance . </s>  The rest of that summer and all through the six months of night the king left his icy cavern only to fish or catch seals for food . </s>  He felt no shame at his feathery covering ,  but it was still strange to him ,  and he avoided meeting any of his brother bears . </s>  During this period of retirement he thought much of the men who had harmed him ,  and remembered the way they had made the great  " bang !

" Only the strongest is fit to rule our race . </s>  "  There was silence for a time ,  but at length a great bear moved to the front and said :   " I will fight him ;  I -- Woof -- the strongest of our race !  And I will be King of the Polar Bears . </s>  "  The others nodded assent ,  and dispatched a messenger to the king to say he must fight the great Woof and master him or resign his sovereignty . </s>  " For a bear with feathers ,  "  added the messenger ,   " is no bear at all ,  and the king we obey must resemble the rest of us . </s>  "   " I wear feathers because it pleases me ,  "  growled the king . </s>  " Am I not a great magician ?  But I will fight ,  nevertheless ,  and if Woof masters me he shall be king in my stead . </s>  "  Then he visited his friends ,  the gulls ,  who were even then feasting upon the dead bear ,  and told them of the coming battle .

They were late . </s>  The king ' s great battle was upon the seventh day ,  and they must fly swiftly to reach the Polar regions by that time . Meanwhile the bird-bear was preparing for his fight . </s>  He sharpened his claws in the small crevasses of the ice . He caught a seal and tested his big yellow teeth by crunching its bones between them . </s>

The sun has had his face washed . </s>  Look how bright he is !   Do get my hat ,  and let us go out for a walk . </s>  Oh ,  dear !  oh ,  dear !  how happy I am !  '  Lootie was very glad to please the princess . </s>  She got her hat and cloak ,  and they set out together for a walk up the mountain ;  for the road was so hard and steep that the water could not rest upon it ,  and it was always dry enough for walking a few minutes after the rain ceased . </s>  The clouds were rolling away in broken pieces ,  like great ,  overwoolly sheep ,  whose wool the sun had bleached till it was almost too white for the eyes to bear . </s>  Between them the sky shone with a deeper and purer blue ,  because of the rain . The trees on the roadside were hung all over with drops ,  which sparkled in the sun like jewels . </s>  The only things that were no brighter for the rain were the brooks that ran down the mountain ;  they had changed from the clearness of crystal to a muddy brown ;  but what they lost in colour they gained in sound -- or at least in noise ,  for a brook when it is swollen is not so musical as before . </s>  But Irene was in raptures with the great brown streams tumbling down everywhere ;  and Lootie shared in her delight ,  for she too had been confined to the house for three days . </s>  At length she observed that the sun was getting low ,  and said it was time to be going back . </s>  She made the remark again and again ,  but ,  every time ,  the princess begged her to go on just a little farther and a little farther ;  reminding her that it was much easier to go downhill ,  and saying that when they did turn they would be at home in a moment . </s>  So on and on they did go ,  now to look at a group of ferns over whose tops a stream was pouring in a watery arch ,  now to pick a shining stone from a rock by the wayside ,  now to watch the flight of some bird . </s>  Suddenly the shadow of a great mountain peak came up from behind ,  and shot in front of them . </s>  When the nurse saw it ,  she started and shook ,  and catching hold of the princess ' s hand turned and began to run down the hill . </s>  ' What ' s all the haste ,  nursie ?  '  asked Irene ,  running alongside of her . ' We must not be out a moment longer . </s>  '   ' But we ca not help being out a good many moments longer . '  It was too true . The nurse almost cried . They were much too far from home . </s>  It was against express orders to be out with the princess one moment after the sun was down ;  and they were nearly a mile up the mountain !   If His Majesty ,  Irene ' s papa ,  were to hear of it ,  Lootie would certainly be dismissed ;  and to leave the princess would break her heart . </s>  It was no wonder she ran . But Irene was not in the least frightened ,  not knowing anything to be frightened at . </s>  She kept on chattering as well as she could ,  but it was not easy . ' Lootie !  Lootie !  why do you run so fast ?   It shakes my teeth when I talk . </s>  '   ' Then do not talk ,  '  said Lootie . ' But the princess went on talking . </s>  She was always saying :   ' Look ,  look ,  Lootie !  '  but Lootie paid no more heed to anything she said ,  only ran on . </s>  ' Look ,  look ,  Lootie !   Do not you see that funny man peeping over the rock ?  '  Lootie only ran the faster . </s>  They had to pass the rock ,  and when they came nearer ,  the princess saw it was only a lump of the rock itself that she had taken for a man . </s>  ' Look ,  look ,  Lootie !   There ' s such a curious creature at the foot of that old tree . Look at it ,  Lootie !   It ' s making faces at us ,  I do think . </s>  '  Lootie gave a stifled cry ,  and ran faster still -- so fast that Irene ' s little legs could not keep up with her ,  and she fell with a crash . </s>  It was a hard downhill road ,  and she had been running very fast -- so it was no wonder she began to cry . </s>  This put the nurse nearly beside herself ;  but all she could do was to run on ,  the moment she got the princess on her feet again . </s>  ' Who ' s that laughing at me ?  '  said the princess ,  trying to keep in her sobs ,  and running too fast for her grazed knees . </s>  ' Nobody ,  child ,  '  said the nurse ,  almost angrily . </s>  But that instant there came a burst of coarse tittering from somewhere near ,  and a hoarse indistinct voice that seemed to say :   ' Lies !  lies !  lies !  '   ' Oh !  '  cried the nurse with a sigh that was almost a scream ,  and ran on faster than ever . </s>  ' Nursie !  Lootie !  I ca not run any more . Do let us walk a bit . '   ' What am I to do ?  '  said the nurse . ' Here ,  I will carry you . </s>  '  She caught her up ;  but found her much too heavy to run with ,  and had to set her down again . </s>  Then she looked wildly about her ,  gave a great cry ,  and said :   ' We have taken the wrong turning somewhere ,  and I do not know where we are . </s>  We are lost ,  lost !  '  The terror she was in had quite bewildered her . It was true enough they had lost the way . </s>  They had been running down into a little valley in which there was no house to be seen . </s>  Now Irene did not know what good reason there was for her nurse ' s terror ,  for the servants had all strict orders never to mention the goblins to her ,  but it was very discomposing to see her nurse in such a fright . </s>  Before ,  however ,  she had time to grow thoroughly alarmed like her ,  she heard the sound of whistling ,  and that revived her . </s>  Presently she saw a boy coming up the road from the valley to meet them . He was the whistler ;  but before they met his whistling changed to singing . </s>  And this is something like what he sang :     ' Ring !  dod !  bang !    Go the hammers '  clang !    Hit and turn and bore !    Whizz and puff and roar !    Thus we rive the rocks ,    Force the goblin locks . </s>  --    See the shining ore !    One ,  two ,  three --    Bright as gold can be !    Four ,  five ,  six --    Shovels ,  mattocks ,  picks !    Seven ,  eight ,  nine --    Light your lamp at mine . </s>  Ten ,  eleven ,  twelve --    Loosely hold the helve . We are the merry miner-boys ,    Make the goblins hold their noise . </s>  '   ' I wish YOU would hold your noise ,  '  said the nurse rudely ,  for the very word GOBLIN at such a time and in such a place made her tremble . </s>  It would bring the goblins upon them to a certainty ,  she thought ,  to defy them in that way . But whether the boy heard her or not ,  he did not stop his singing . </s>  ' Thirteen ,  fourteen ,  fifteen --    This is worth the siftin '  ;    Sixteen ,  seventeen ,  eighteen --    There ' s the match ,  and lay ' t in . </s>  Nineteen ,  twenty --    Goblins in a plenty . '   ' Do be quiet ,  '  cried the nurse ,  in a whispered shriek . </s>  But the boy ,  who was now close at hand ,  still went on .

The next moment ,  through the open doorway came the princess Irene . </s>  She went straight up to her father ,  with her right hand stretched out a little sideways ,  and her forefinger ,  as her father and Curdie understood ,  feeling its way along the invisible thread . </s>  The king took her on his knee ,  and she said in his ear :   ' King-papa ,  do you hear that noise ?  '   ' I hear nothing ,  '  said the king . </s>  ' Listen ,  '  she said ,  holding up her forefinger . The king listened ,  and a great stillness fell upon the company . </s>  Each man ,  seeing that the king listened ,  listened also ,  and the harper sat with his harp between his arms ,  and his finger silent upon the strings . </s>  ' I do hear a noise ,  '  said the king at length --  ' a noise as of distant thunder . It is coming nearer and nearer . </s>  What can it be ?  '  They all heard it now ,  and each seemed ready to start to his feet as he listened . Yet all sat perfectly still . The noise came rapidly nearer . </s>  ' What can it be ?  '  said the king again . ' I think it must be another storm coming over the mountain ,  '  said Sir Walter . </s>  Then Curdie ,  who at the first word of the king had slipped from his seat ,  and laid his ear to the ground ,  rose up quickly ,  and approaching the king said ,  speaking very fast :   ' Please ,  Your Majesty ,  I think I know what it is . </s>  I have no time to explain ,  for that might make it too late for some of us . </s>  Will Your Majesty give orders that everybody leave the house as quickly as possible and get up the mountain ?  '  The king ,  who was the wisest man in the kingdom ,  knew well there was a time when things must be done and questions left till afterwards . </s>  He had faith in Curdie ,  and rose instantly ,  with Irene in his arms . ' Every man and woman follow me ,  '  he said ,  and strode out into the darkness . </s>  Before he had reached the gate ,  the noise had grown to a great thundering roar ,  and the ground trembled beneath their feet ,  and before the last of them had crossed the court ,  out after them from the great hall door came a huge rush of turbid water ,  and almost swept them away . </s>  But they got safe out of the gate and up the mountain ,  while the torrent went roaring down the road into the valley beneath . </s>  Curdie had left the king and the princess to look after his mother ,  whom he and his father ,  one on each side ,  caught up when the stream overtook them and carried safe and dry . </s>  When the king had got out of the way of the water ,  a little up the mountain ,  he stood with the princess in his arms ,  looking back with amazement on the issuing torrent ,  which glimmered fierce and foamy through the night . </s>  There Curdie rejoined them . </s>  ' Now ,  Curdie ,  '  said the king ,   ' what does it mean ?   Is this what you expected ?  '   ' It is ,  Your Majesty ,  '  said Curdie ;  and proceeded to tell him about the second scheme of the goblins ,  who ,  fancying the miners of more importance to the upper world than they were ,  had resolved ,  if they should fail in carrying off the king ' s daughter ,  to flood the mine and drown the miners . </s>  Then he explained what the miners had done to prevent it . </s>  The goblins had ,  in pursuance of their design ,  let loose all the underground reservoirs and streams ,  expecting the water to run down into the mine ,  which was lower than their part of the mountain ,  for they had ,  as they supposed ,  not knowing of the solid wall close behind ,  broken a passage through into it . </s>  But the readiest outlet the water could find had turned out to be the tunnel they had made to the king ' s house ,  the possibility of which catastrophe had not occurred to the young miner until he had laid his ear to the floor of the hall . </s>  What was then to be done ?   The house appeared in danger of falling ,  and every moment the torrent was increasing . ' We must set out at once ,  '  said the king . </s>  ' But how to get at the horses !  '   ' Shall I see if we can manage that ?  '  said Curdie . ' Do ,  '  said the king . </s>  Curdie gathered the men-at-arms ,  and took them over the garden wall ,  and so to the stables . </s>  They found their horses in terror ;  the water was rising fast around them ,  and it was quite time they were got out . </s>  But there was no way to get them out ,  except by riding them through the stream ,  which was now pouring from the lower windows as well as the door . </s>  As one horse was quite enough for any man to manage through such a torrent ,  Curdie got on the king ' s white charger and ,  leading the way ,  brought them all in safety to the rising ground . </s>  ' Look ,  look ,  Curdie !  '  cried Irene ,  the moment that ,  having dismounted ,  he led the horse up to the king . </s>  Curdie did look ,  and saw ,  high in the air ,  somewhere about the top of the king ' s house ,  a great globe of light shining like the purest silver . </s>  ' Oh !

' Here ,  Curdie ,  take the princess while I get on my horse ,  '  said the king . </s>  Curdie took the princess again ,  and both turned their eyes to the globe of light . </s>  The same moment there shot from it a white bird ,  which ,  descending with outstretched wings ,  made one circle round the king an Curdie and the princess ,  and then glided up again . </s>  The light and the pigeon vanished together . </s>  ' Now ,  Curdie !  '  said the princess ,  as he lifted her to her father ' s arms ,   ' you see my grandmother knows all about it ,  and is not frightened . </s>  I believe she could walk through that water and it would not wet her a bit . </s>  '   ' But ,  my child ,  '  said the king ,   ' you will be cold if you have not Something more on . </s>  Run ,  Curdie ,  my boy ,  and fetch anything you can lay your hands on ,  to keep the princess warm . We have a long ride before us . </s>  '  Curdie was gone in a moment ,  and soon returned with a great rich fur ,  and the news that dead goblins were tossing about in the current through the house . </s>  They had been caught in their own snare ;  instead of the mine they had flooded their own country ,  whence they were now swept up drowned . </s>  Irene shuddered ,  but the king held her close to his bosom . Then he turned to Sir Walter ,  and said :   ' Bring Curdie ' s father and mother here . </s>  '   ' I wish ,  '  said the king ,  when they stood before him ,   ' to take your son with me . He shall enter my bodyguard at once ,  and wait further promotion . </s>  '  Peter and his wife ,  overcome ,  only murmured almost inaudible thanks . But Curdie spoke aloud . ' Please ,  Your Majesty ,  '  he said ,   ' I cannot leave my father and mother . </s>  '   ' That ' s right ,  Curdie !  '  cried the princess .

"   " Why ,  "  said Fin ,   " ever since I was the height of a round tower ,  I was known to be fond of having a good prospect of my own ;  and where the dickens ,  neighbours ,  could I find a better spot for a good prospect than the top of Knockmany ?  As for water ,  I am sinking a pump ,  and ,  plase goodness ,  as soon as the Causeway ' s made ,  I intend to finish it . </s>  "  Now ,  this was more of Fin ' s philosophy ;  for the real state of the case was ,  that he pitched upon the top of Knockmany in order that he might be able to see Cucullin coming towards the house . </s>  All we have to say is ,  that if he wanted a spot from which to keep a sharp look-out -- and ,  between ourselves ,  he did want it grievously -- barring Slieve Croob ,  or Slieve Donard ,  or its own cousin ,  Cullamore ,  he could not find a neater or more convenient situation for it in the sweet and sagacious province of Ulster . </s>  " God save all here !  "  said Fin ,  good-humouredly ,  on putting his honest face into his own door . </s>  " Musha ,  Fin ,  avick ,  an '  you are welcome home to your own Oonagh ,  you darlin '  bully . </s>  "  Here followed a smack that is said to have made the waters of the lake at the bottom of the hill curl ,  as it were ,  with kindness and sympathy . </s>  Fin spent two or three happy days with Oonagh ,  and felt himself very comfortable ,  considering the dread he had of Cucullin . </s>  This ,  however ,  grew upon him so much that his wife could not but perceive something lay on his mind which he kept altogether to himself . </s>  Let a woman alone ,  in the meantime ,  for ferreting or wheedling a secret out of her good man ,  when she wishes . Fin was a proof of this . </s>  " It ' s this Cucullin ,  "  said he ,   " that ' s troubling me . </s>  When the fellow gets angry ,  and begins to stamp ,  he will shake you a whole townland ;  and it ' s well known that he can stop a thunderbolt ,  for he always carries one about him in the shape of a pancake ,  to show to any one that might misdoubt it . </s>  "  As he spoke ,  he clapped his thumb in his mouth ,  which he always did when he wanted to prophesy ,  or to know anything that happened in his absence ;  and the wife asked him what he did it for . </s>  " He ' s coming ,  "  said Fin ;   " I see him below Dungannon . </s>  "   " Thank goodness ,  dear !  an '  who is it ,  avick ?  Glory be to God !

"  said she . " To-morrow ,  about two o ' clock ,  "  replied Fin ,  with a groan . </s>  " Well ,  my bully ,  do not be cast down ,  "  said Oonagh ;   " depend on me ,  and maybe I will bring you better out of this scrape than ever you could bring yourself ,  by your rule o '  thumb . </s>  "  She then made a high smoke on the top of the hill ,  after which she put her finger in her mouth ,  and gave three whistles ,  and by that Cucullin knew he was invited to Cullamore -- for this was the way that the Irish long ago gave a sign to all strangers and travellers ,  to let them know they were welcome to come and take share of whatever was going . </s>  In the meantime ,  Fin was very melancholy ,  and did not know what to do ,  or how to act at all . </s>  Cucullin was an ugly customer to meet with ;  and ,  the idea of the  " cake "  aforesaid flattened the very heart within him . </s>  What chance could he have ,  strong and brave though he was ,  with a man who could ,  when put in a passion ,  walk the country into earthquakes and knock thunderbolts into pancakes ?  Fin knew not on what hand to turn him . </s>  Right or left -- backward or forward -- where to go he could form no guess whatsoever . </s>  " Oonagh ,  "  said he ,   " can you do nothing for me ?  Where ' s all your invention ?  Am I to be skivered like a rabbit before your eyes ,  and to have my name disgraced for ever in the sight of all my tribe ,  and me the best man among them ?  How am I to fight this man-mountain -- this huge cross between an earthquake and a thunderbolt ?  -- with a pancake in his pocket that was once --  "   " Be easy ,  Fin ,  "  replied Oonagh ;   " troth ,  I am ashamed of you .

"  asked the henwife . </s>  " A dress red as a rose from the waist down ,  and white as snow from the waist up ;  a cape of green on my shoulders ;  and a hat on my head with a red ,  a white ,  and a green feather in it ;  and shoes for my feet with the toes red ,  the middle white ,  and the backs and heels green . </s>  "  The henwife put on the cloak of darkness ,  wished for all these things ,  and had them . </s>  When Trembling was dressed ,  the henwife put the honey-bird on her right shoulder and the honey-finger on her left ,  and ,  placing the hat on her head ,  clipped a few hairs from one lock and a few from another with her scissors ,  and that moment the most beautiful golden hair was flowing down over the girl ' s shoulders . </s>  Then the henwife asked what kind of a mare she would ride . </s>  She said white ,  with blue and gold-coloured diamond-shaped spots all over her body ,  on her back a saddle of gold ,  and on her head a golden bridle . </s>  The mare stood there before the door ,  and a bird sitting between her ears ,  which began to sing as soon as Trembling was in the saddle ,  and never stopped till she came home from the church . </s>  The fame of the beautiful strange lady had gone out through the world ,  and all the princes and great men that were in it came to church that Sunday ,  each one hoping that it was himself would have her home with him after Mass .
