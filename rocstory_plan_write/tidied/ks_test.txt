What should any man be doing here ?  '  The nyamatsanes paid no attention to her ,  and began to open all the cupboards ,  and peep under all the beds ,  crying out all the while ,   ' A man is here !  a man is here !  '  but they could find nobody ,  and at length ,  tired out with their long day ' s hunting ,  they curled themselves up and fell asleep . </s>  Next morning they woke up quite refreshed ,  and made ready to start on another expedition ;  but as they did not feel happy about their grandmother they said to her ,   ' Grandmother ,  wo not you come to-day and feed with us ?

'   ' Nothing is likely to escape her eyes ,  certainly not a young man ,  said the other bird . </s>  ' Will the youth have the sense not to let himself be caught in her toils ?  '   ' We will wait ,  '  said the first bird ,   ' and see how they get on together . </s>  '  The evening light had quite faded ,  and the full moon was already shining down upon the forest ,  when the young man heard a slight rustling sound . </s>  After a few moments there came out of the forest a maiden ,  gliding over the grass so lightly that her feet seemed scarcely to touch the ground ,  and stood beside the spring . </s>  The youth could not turn away his eyes from the maiden ,  for he had never in his life seen a woman so beautiful .

The men unbuckled their knapsacks and filled them with those precious things . </s>  In the middle of the garden they found a large lake ,  and when they reached the edge of it the Lake began to speak ,  and said to them ,   ' What men are you ,  and what brings you here ?  Are you come to visit our king ?

The Lake answered that it had been done by people who had come to do him homage . </s>  The King commanded that the men should be brought before him . They came humbly on their knees ,  and in a few words told him their story . </s>  Then he spoke to them with a mighty and terrible voice ,  and said ,   ' Because you have dared to come here ,  I lay upon you the punishment . </s>  Every year you must bring me from among your people twelve youths and twelve maidens ,  that I may devour them .

 she was so old that she only had one eye and one tooth left ,  and even these poor remains she had to keep all night in a strengthening liquid . </s>  She was also so spiteful that she gladly devoted all her time to carrying out all the mean or ill-natured tricks of the whole body of fairies . </s>  With her large experience ,  added to her native spite ,  she found but little difficulty in carrying off Fairer-than-a-Fairy . </s>  The poor child ,  who was only seven years old ,  nearly died of fear on finding herself in the power of this hideous creature . </s>  However ,  when after an hour ' s journey underground she found herself in a splendid palace with lovely gardens ,  she felt a little reassured ,  and was further cheered when she discovered that her pet cat and dog had followed her . </s>  The old Fairy led her to a pretty room which she said should be hers ,  at the same time giving her the strictest orders never to let out the fire which was burning brightly in the grate . </s>  She then gave two glass bottles into the Princess ' s charge ,  desiring her to take the greatest care of them ,  and having enforced her orders with the most awful threats in case of disobedience ,  she vanished ,  leaving the little girl at liberty to explore the palace and grounds and a good deal relieved at having only two apparently easy tasks set her . </s>  Several years passed ,  during which time the Princess grew accustomed to her lonely life ,  obeyed the Fairy ' s orders ,  and by degrees forgot all about the court of the King her father . </s>  One day ,  whilst passing near a fountain in the garden ,  she noticed that the sun ' s rays fell on the water in such a manner as to produce a brilliant rainbow . </s>  She stood still to admire it ,  when ,  to her great surprise ,  she heard a voice addressing her which seemed to come from the centre of its rays . </s>  The voice was that of a young man ,  and its sweetness of tone and the agreeable things it uttered ,  led one to infer that its owner must be equally charming ;  but this had to be a mere matter of fancy ,  for no one was visible . </s>  The beautiful Rainbow informed Fairer-than-a-Fairy that he was young ,  the son of a powerful king ,  and that the Fairy ,  Lagree ,  who owed his parents a grudge ,  had revenged herself by depriving him of his natural shape for some years ;  that she had imprisoned him in the palace ,  where he had found his confinement hard to bear for some time ,  but now ,  he owned ,  he no longer sighed for freedom since he had seen and learned to love Fairer-than-a-Fairy . </s>  He added many other tender speeches to this declaration ,  and the Princess ,  to whom such remarks were a new experience ,  could not help feeling pleased and touched by his attentions . </s>  The Prince could only appear or speak under the form of a Rainbow ,  and it was therefore necessary that the sun should shine on water so as to enable the rays to form themselves . </s>  Fairer-than-a-Fairy lost no moment in which she could meet her lover ,  and they enjoyed many long and interesting interviews . </s>  One day ,  however ,  their conversation became so absorbing and time passed so quickly that the Princess forgot to attend to the fire ,  and it went out . </s>  Lagree ,  on her return ,  soon found out the neglect ,  and seemed only too pleased to have the opportunity of showing her spite to her lovely prisoner . </s>  She ordered Fairer-than-a-Fairy to start next day at dawn to ask Locrinos for fire with which to relight the one she had allowed to go out . </s>  Now this Locrinos was a cruel monster who devoured everyone he came across ,  and especially enjoyed a chance of catching and eating any young girls . </s>  Our heroine obeyed with great sweetness ,  and without having been able to take leave of her lover she set off to go to Locrinos as to certain death . </s>  As she was crossing a wood a bird sang to her to pick up a shining pebble which she would find in a fountain close by ,  and to use it when needed . </s>  She took the bird ' s advice ,  and in due time arrived at the house of Locrinos . </s>  Luckily she only found his wife at home ,  who was much struck by the Princess ' s youth and beauty and sweet gentle manners ,  and still further impressed by the present of the shining pebble . </s>  She readily let Fairer-than-a-Fairy have the fire ,  and in return for the stone she gave her another ,  which ,  she said ,  might prove useful some day . </s>  Then she sent her away without doing her any harm . </s>  Lagree was as much surprised as displeased at the happy result of this expedition ,  and Fairer-than-a Fairy waited anxiously for an opportunity of meeting Prince Rainbow and telling him her adventures . </s>  She found ,  however ,  that he had already been told all about them by a Fairy who protected him ,  and to whom he was related . </s>  The dread of fresh dangers to his beloved Princess made him devise some more convenient way of meeting than by the garden fountain ,  and Fairer-than-a-Fairy carried out his plan daily with entire success . </s>  Every morning she placed a large basin full of water on her window-sill ,  and as soon as the sun ' s rays fell on the water the Rainbow appeared as clearly as it had ever done in the fountain . </s>  By this means they were able to meet without losing sight of the fire or of the two bottles in which the old Fairy kept her eye and her tooth at night ,  and for some time the lovers enjoyed every hour of sunshine together . </s>  One day Prince Rainbow appeared in the depths of woe . He had just heard that he was to be banished from this lovely spot ,  but he had no idea where he was to go . </s>  The poor young couple were in despair ,  and only parted with the last ray of sunshine ,  and in hopes of meeting next morning . </s>  Alas !  next day was dark and gloomy ,  and it was only late in the afternoon that the sun broke through the clouds for a few minutes . </s>  Fairer-than-a-Fairy eagerly ran to the window ,  but in her haste she upset the basin ,  and spilt all the water with which she had carefully filled it overnight . </s>  No other water was at hand except that in the two bottles . </s>  It was the only chance of seeing her lover before they were separated ,  and she did not hesitate to break the bottle and pour their contents into the basin ,  when the Rainbow appeared at once . </s>  Their farewells were full of tenderness ;  the Prince made the most ardent and sincere protestations ,  and promised to neglect nothing which might help to deliver his dear Fairer-than-a-Fairy from her captivity ,  and implored her to consent to their marriage as soon as they should both be free . </s>  The Princess ,  on her side ,  vowed to have no other husband ,  and declared herself willing to brave death itself in order to rejoin him . </s>  They were not allowed much time for their adieus ;  the Rainbow vanished ,  and the Princess ,  resolved to run all risks ,  started off at once ,  taking nothing with her but her dog ,  her cat ,  a sprig of myrtle ,  and the stone which the wife of Locrinos gave her . </s>  When Lagree became aware of her prisoner ' s flight she was furious ,  and set off at full speed in pursuit . </s>  She overtook her just as the poor girl ,  overcome by fatigue ,  had lain down to rest in a cave which the stone had formed itself into to shelter her . </s>  The little dog who was watching her mistress promptly flew at Lagree and bit her so severely that she stumbled against a corner of the cave and broke off her only tooth .

The youth ran to look at it ,  and saw that a huge abyss had opened below the stone . </s>  He went at once to fetch his brothers ,  and with their help dragged a lot of pine-wood and ropes to the spot . </s>  They fastened some of the burning pine-wood to the end of the rope ,  and let it slowly down to the bottom of the abyss . </s>  At first it was quite dark ,  and the flaming torch only lit up dirty grey stone walls . </s>  But the youngest brother determined to explore the abyss ,  and letting himself down by the rope he soon reached the bottom . </s>  Here he found a lovely meadow full of green trees and exquisite flowers . </s>  In the middle of the meadow stood a huge stone castle ,  with an iron gate leading to it ,  which was wide open . </s>  Everything in the castle seemed to be made of copper ,  and the only inhabitant he could discover was a lovely girl ,  who was combing her golden hair ;  and he noticed that whenever one of her hairs fell on the ground it rang out like pure metal . </s>  The youth looked at her more closely ,  and saw that her skin was smooth and fair ,  her blue eyes bright and sparkling ,  and her hair as golden as the sun . </s>  He fell in love with her on the spot ,  and kneeling at her feet ,  he implored her to become his wife . </s>  The lovely girl accepted his proposal gladly ;  but at the same time she warned him that she could never come up to the world above till her mother ,  the old witch ,  was dead . </s>  And she went on to tell him that the only way in which the old creature could be killed was with the sword that hung up in the castle ;  but the sword was so heavy that no one could lift it . </s>  Then the youth went into a room in the castle where everything was made of silver ,  and here he found another beautiful girl ,  the sister of his bride . </s>  She was combing her silver hair ,  and every hair that fell on the ground rang out like pure metal . </s>  The second girl handed him the sword ,  but though he tried with all his strength he could not lift it . </s>  At last a third sister came to him and gave him a drop of something to drink ,  which she said would give him the needful strength . </s>  He drank one drop ,  but still he could not lift the sword ;  then he drank a second ,  and the sword began to move ;  but only after he had drunk a third drop was he able to swing the sword over his head . </s>  Then he hid himself in the castle and awaited the old witch ' s arrival . At last as it was beginning to grow dark she appeared . </s>  She swooped down upon a big apple-tree ,  and after shaking some golden apples from it ,  she pounced down upon the earth . </s>  As soon as her feet touched the ground she became transformed from a hawk into a woman . </s>  This was the moment the youth was waiting for ,  and he swung his mighty sword in the air with all his strength and the witch ' s head fell off ,  and her blood spurted up on the walls . </s>  Without fear of any further danger ,  he packed up all the treasures of the castle into great chests ,  and gave his brothers a signal to pull them up out of the abyss . </s>  First the treasures were attached to the rope and then the three lovely girls .

It is in vain that I have hidden them under the earth and locked them into the castle . </s>  Now I have hidden them in the apple-tree ;  hide yourself there too ,  and at midnight you will see my enemy . </s>  '  The youth climbed up the tree ,  and picked some of the beautiful golden apples ,  which he ate for his supper . </s>  At midnight the wind began to rise ,  and a rustling sound was heard at the foot of the tree . </s>  The youth looked down and beheld a long thick serpent beginning to crawl up the tree .

He burst into a room where they were all assembled ,  but no one knew who he was . </s>  Only his bride ,  who was serving as cook to her sisters ,  recognised her lover at once . </s>  His brothers ,  who had quite believed he was dead ,  yielded him up his treasures at once ,  and flew into the woods in terror . </s>  But the good youth forgave them all they had done ,  and divided his treasures with them . </s>  Then he built himself a big castle with golden windows ,  and there he lived happily with his golden-haired wife till the end of their lives .

'   ' Over there ,  at the edge of the forest in the little hut you see in the distance ,  '  replied the old woman . </s>  The Prince lifted her on to his horse ,  and soon they reached the hut ,  where the old woman got down ,  and turning to the Prince said ,   ' Just wait a moment ,  and I will give you something . </s>  '  And she disappeared into her hut ,  but returned very soon and said ,   ' You are a mighty Prince ,  but at the same time you have a kind heart ,  which deserves to be rewarded . </s>  Would you like to have the most beautiful woman in the world for your wife ?  '   ' Most certainly I would ,  '  replied the Prince . </s>  So the old woman continued ,   ' The most beautiful woman in the whole world is the daughter of the Queen of the Flowers ,  who has been captured by a dragon . </s>  If you wish to marry her ,  you must first set her free ,  and this I will help you to do . </s>  I will give you this little bell :  if you ring it once ,  the King of the Eagles will appear ;  if you ring it twice ,  the King of the Foxes will come to you ;  and if you ring it three times ,  you will see the King of the Fishes by your side . </s>  These will help you if you are in any difficulty . Now farewell ,  and heaven prosper your undertaking . </s>  '  She handed him the little bell ,  and there disappeared hut and all ,  as though the earth had swallowed her up . </s>  Then it dawned on the Prince that he had been speaking to a good fairy ,  and putting the little bell carefully in his pocket ,  he rode home and told his father that he meant to set the daughter of the Flower Queen free ,  and intended setting out on the following day into the wide world in search of the maid . </s>  So the next morning the Prince mounted his fine horse and left his home . </s>  He had roamed round the world for a whole year ,  and his horse had died of exhaustion ,  while he himself had suffered much from want and misery ,  but still he had come on no trace of her he was in search of . </s>  At last one day he came to a hut ,  in front of which sat a very old man . </s>  The Prince asked him ,   ' Do you not know where the Dragon lives who keeps the daughter of the Flower Queen prisoner ?  '   ' No ,  I do not ,  '  answered the old man . </s>  ' But if you go straight along this road for a year ,  you will reach a hut where my father lives ,  and possibly he may be able to tell you . </s>  '  The Prince thanked him for his information ,  and continued his journey for a whole year along the same road ,  and at the end of it came to the little hut ,  where he found a very old man . </s>  He asked him the same question ,  and the old man answered ,   ' No ,  I do not know where the Dragon lives . </s>  But go straight along this road for another year ,  and you will come to a hut in which my father lives .

But no sooner had they reached the grass than she vanished . </s>  The Prince sought for her in vain ,  and at last in despair sat down on a big stone and contemplated his sad fate . </s>  As he sat thus lost in thought ,  he noticed an eagle flying over his head . </s>  Then he suddenly bethought him of his little bell ,  and taking it out of his pocket he rang it once . </s>  In a moment he heard a rustling sound in the air beside him ,  and the King of the Eagles sank at his feet .

Time went past ,  and the King ,  growing tired of living alone ,  fitted out his ship and sailed out to sea . </s>  As he sailed there came upon him so thick a mist that he altogether lost his bearings ,  but after long trouble he found land . </s>  There he laid his ship to ,  and went on shore all alone . After walking for some time he came to a forest ,  into which he went a little way and stopped . </s>  Then he heard sweet music from a harp ,  and went in the direction of the sound until he came to a clearing ,  and there he saw three women ,  one of whom sat on a golden chair ,  and was beautifully and grandly dressed ;  she held a harp in her hands ,  and was very sorrowful . </s>  The second was also finely dressed ,  but younger in appearance ,  and also sat on a chair ,  but it was not so grand as the first one ' s . </s>  The third stood beside them ,  and was very pretty to look at ;  she had a green cloak over her other clothes ,  and it was easy to see that she was maid to the other two . </s>  After the King had looked at them for a little he went forward and saluted them . </s>  The one that sat on the golden chair asked him who he was and where he was going ;  and he told her all the story -- how he was a king ,  and had lost his queen ,  and was now on his way to Hetland the Good ,  to ask the Queen of that country in marriage . </s>  She answered that fortune had contrived this wonderfully ,  for pirates had plundered Hetland and killed the King ,  and she had fled from the land in terror ,  and had come hither after great trouble ,  and she was the very person he was looking for ,  and the others were her daughter and maid . </s>  The King immediately asked her hand ;  she gladly received his proposal and accepted him at once . </s>  Thereafter they all set out ,  and made their way to the ship ;  and after that nothing is told of their voyage until the King reached his own country . </s>  There he made a great feast ,  and celebrated his marriage with this woman ;  and after that things are quiet for a time . </s>  Hermod and Hadvor took but little notice of the Queen and her daughter ,  but ,  on the other hand ,  Hadvor and the Queen ' s maid ,  whose name was Olof ,  were very friendly ,  and Olof came often to visit Hadvor in her castle . </s>  Before long the King went out to war ,  and no sooner was he away than the Queen came to talk with Hermod ,  and said that she wanted him to marry her daughter . </s>  Hermod told her straight and plain that he would not do so ,  at which the Queen grew terribly angry ,  and said that in that case neither should he have Hadvor ,  for she would now lay this spell on him ,  that he should go to a desert island and there be a lion by day and a man by night . </s>  He should also think always of Hadvor ,  which would cause him all the more sorrow ,  and from this spell he should never be freed until Hadvor burned the lion ' s skin ,  and that would not happen very soon . </s>  As soon as the Queen had finished her speech Hermod replied that he also laid a spell on her ,  and that was ,  that as soon as he was freed from her enchantments she should become a rat and her daughter a mouse ,  and fight with each other in the hall until he killed them with his sword . </s>  After this Hermod disappeared ,  and no one knew what had become of him ;  the Queen caused search to be made for him ,  but he could nowhere be found . </s>  One time ,  when Olof was in the castle beside Hadvor ,  she asked the Princess if she knew where Hermod had gone to .

One night ,  not long after ,  a loud noise and rumbling was heard under the castle . </s>  Hadvor at once guessed what it was ,  and told her maids to be ready to help her . </s>  The noise and thundering grew louder and louder ,  until the floor began to open ,  whereupon Hadvor made them take the caldron of pitch and pour plenty of it into the opening . </s>  With that the noises grew fainter and fainter ,  till at last they ceased altogether . </s>  Next morning the Queen rose early ,  and went out to the Palace gate ,  and there she found her brother the Giant lying dead . </s>  She went up to him and said ,   ' I pronounce this spell ,  that you become a beautiful prince ,  and that Hadvor shall be unable to say anything against the charges that I shall bring against her . </s>  '  The body of the dead Giant now became that of a beautiful prince ,  and the Queen went in again . </s>  ' I do not think ,  '  said she to the King ,   ' that your daughter is as good as she is said to be . </s>  My brother came and asked her hand ,  and she has had him put to death . I have just found his dead body lying at the Palace gate . </s>  '  The King went along with the Queen to see the body ,  and thought it all very strange ;  so beautiful a youth ,  he said ,  would have been a worthy match for Hadvor ,  and he would readily have agreed to their marriage .

And this happened every night . </s>  The shepherd bewailed himself in vain :  the dragon only laughed ,  and Stan saw that this was not the place to get food for his family . </s>  But though he quite understood that it was almost hopeless to fight against such a powerful monster ,  yet the thought of the hungry children at home clung to him like a burr ,  and would not be shaken off ,  and at last he said to the shepherd ,   ' What will you give me if I rid you of the dragon ?  '   ' One of every three rams ,  one of every three sheep ,  one of every three lambs ,  '  answered the herd . </s>  ' It is a bargain ,  '  replied Stan ,  though at the moment he did not know how ,  supposing he DID come off the victor ,  he would ever be able to drive so large a flock home . </s>  However ,  that matter could be settled later . At present night was not far off ,  and he must consider how best to fight with the dragon . </s>  Just at midnight ,  a horrible feeling that was new and strange to him came over Stan -- a feeling that he could not put into words even to himself ,  but which almost forced him to give up the battle and take the shortest road home again . </s>  He half turned ;  then he remembered the children ,  and turned back . ' You or I ,  '  said Stan to himself ,  and took up his position on the edge of the flock . </s>  ' Stop !  '  he suddenly cried ,  as the air was filled with a rushing noise ,  and the dragon came dashing past . ' Dear me !  '  exclaimed the dragon ,  looking round . </s>  ' Who are you ,  and where do you come from ?  '   ' I am Stan Bolovan ,  who eats rocks all night ,  and in the day feeds on the flowers of the mountain ;  and if you meddle with those sheep I will carve a cross on your back . </s>  '  When the dragon heard these words he stood quite still in the middle of the road ,  for he knew he had met with his match . </s>  ' But you will have to fight me first ,  '  he said in a trembling voice ,  for when you faced him properly he was not brave at all .

'  he cried ;  but they consulted together and said ,   ' Let us leave him there inside the pit ,  and take his share of the money ,  and we will tell his mother ,   " Your son was caught by a lion and carried off into the forest ,  and we tried to follow him ,  but could not . </s>  "  '  Then they arose and went into the town and told his mother as they had agreed ,  and she wept much and made her mourning for many months . </s>  And when the men were dividing the money ,  one said ,   ' Let us send a little to our friend ' s mother ,  '  and they sent some to her ;  and every day one took her rice ,  and one oil ;  one took her meat ,  and one took her cloth ,  every day . </s>  It did not take long for Hassebu to find out that his companions had left him to die in the pit ,  but he had a brave heart ,  and hoped that he might be able to find a way out for himself . </s>  So he at once began to explore the pit and found it ran back a long way underground . </s>  And by night he slept ,  and by day he took a little of the honey he had gathered and ate it ;  and so many days passed by . </s>  One morning ,  while he was sitting on a rock having his breakfast ,  a large scorpion dropped down at his feet ,  and he took a stone and killed it ,  fearing it would sting him . </s>  Then suddenly the thought darted into his head ,   ' This scorpion must have come from somewhere !

" The merchant was very glad . </s>  On returning to his house ,  he at once sent the dog back to its old master with a letter rolled under the collar ,  wherein he had written about the sagacity of the beast ,  and begged his friend to forget the loan and to accept another five thousand rupees as a present . </s>  When this merchant saw his dog coming back again ,  he thought ,   ' Alas !  my friend is wanting the money . </s>  How can I pay him ?  I have not had sufficient time to recover myself from my recent losses . </s>  I will slay the dog ere he reaches the threshold ,  and say that another must have slain it .

"  He was powerless to eat the man ,  but asked him :   " Why is it ,  young sir ,  that you are not frightened to death ?  "   " Why should I fear ,  Demon ?  "  replied he . </s>  " In one life a man can die but once . </s>  Besides ,  in my belly is a thunderbolt ;  if you eat me ,  you will never be able to digest it ;  this will tear your inwards into little bits ,  and kill you :  so we shall both perish . </s>  That is why I fear nothing . "   ( By this ,  the Bodhisatta meant the weapon of knowledge which he had within him . </s>  )  When he heard this ,  the Demon thought :   " This young man speaks the truth . </s>  A piece of the flesh of such a lion-man as he would be too much for me to digest ,  if it were no bigger than a kidney-bean . </s>  I will let him go !  "  So ,  being frightened to death ,  he let go the Bodhisatta ,  saying :   " Young sir ,  you are a lion of a man !  I will not eat you up . </s>  I set you free from my hands ,  as the moon is disgorged from the jaws of Rahu after the eclipse . </s>  Go back to the company of your friends and relations !  "  And the Bodhisatta said :   " Demon ,  I will go ,  as you say . </s>  You were born a Demon ,  cruel ,  blood-bibbing ,  devourer of the flesh and gore of others ,  because you did wickedly in former lives . </s>  If you still go on doing wickedly ,  you will go from darkness to darkness . But now that you have seen me you will find it impossible to do wickedly . </s>  Taking the life of living creatures causes birth ,  as an animal ,  in the world of Petas ,  or in the body of an Asura ,  or ,  if one is reborn as a man ,  it makes his life short . </s>  "  With this and the like monition he told him the disadvantage of the five kinds of wickedness ,  and the profit of the five kinds of virtue ,  and frightened the Demon in various ways ,  discoursing to him until he subdued him and made him self-denying ,  and established him in the five kinds of virtue ;  he made him worship the deity to whom offerings were made in that wood ;  and having carefully admonished him ,  departed out of it . </s>  At the entrance of the forest he told all to the people thereabout ;  and went on to Benares ,  armed with his five weapons . </s>  Afterwards he became king ,  and ruled righteously ;  and after giving alms and doing good he passed away according to his deeds . </s>  _ And the Teacher ,  when this tale was ended ,  became perfectly enlightened ,  and repeated this verse _  :       _ Whose mind and heart from all desire is free ,      Who seeks for peace by living virtuously ,        He in due time will sever all the bonds     That bind him fast to life ,  and cease to be . </s>  _   _ Thus the Teacher reached the summit ,  through sainthood and the teaching of the law ,  and thereupon he declared the Four Truths . </s>  At the end of the declaring of the Truths ,  this Brother also attained to sainthood . </s>  Then the Teacher made the connexion ,  and gave the key to the birth-tale ,  saying :   " At that time Angulimala was the Demon ,  but the Prince of the Five Weapons was I myself .

" She is like a white rose !  "  they cried ,  and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies . </s>  At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her . He had dreamy violet eyes ,  and his hair was like fine gold . </s>  When he saw her he sank upon one knee ,  and kissed her hand . </s>  " Your picture was beautiful ,  "  he murmured ,   " but you are more beautiful than your picture "  ;  and the little Princess blushed . </s>  " She was like a white rose before ,  "  said a young Page to his neighbour ,   " but she is like a red rose now "  ;  and the whole Court was delighted . </s>  For the next three days everybody went about saying ,   " White rose ,  Red rose ,  Red rose ,  White rose "  ;  and the King gave orders that the Page ' s salary was to be doubled . </s>  As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him ,  but it was considered a great honour ,  and was duly published in the Court Gazette . </s>  When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated . It was a magnificent ceremony ,  and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls . </s>  Then there was a State Banquet ,  which lasted for five hours . The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal . </s>  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup ,  for if false lips touched it ,  it grew grey and dull and cloudy . </s>  " It ' s quite clear that they love each other ,  "  said the little Page ,   " as clear as crystal !  "  and the King doubled his salary a second time . </s>  " What an honour !  "  cried all the courtiers . After the banquet there was to be a Ball . </s>  The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together ,  and the King had promised to play the flute . </s>  He played very badly ,  but no one had ever dared to tell him so ,  because he was the King . </s>  Indeed ,  he knew only two airs ,  and was never quite certain which one he was playing ;  but it made no matter ,  for ,  whatever he did ,  everybody cried out ,   " Charming !  charming !  "  The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks ,  to be let off exactly at midnight . </s>  The little Princess had never seen a firework in her life ,  so the King had given orders that the Royal Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage . </s>  " What are fireworks like ?  "  she had asked the Prince ,  one morning ,  as she was walking on the terrace . </s>  " They are like the Aurora Borealis ,  "  said the King ,  who always answered questions that were addressed to other people ,   " only much more natural . </s>  I prefer them to stars myself ,  as you always know when they are going to appear ,  and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing . You must certainly see them . </s>  "  So at the end of the King ' s garden a great stand had been set up ,  and as soon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place ,  the fireworks began to talk to each other . </s>  " The world is certainly very beautiful ,  "  cried a little Squib .

It came from a tall ,  supercilious-looking Rocket ,  who was tied to the end of a long stick . </s>  He always coughed before he made any observation ,  so as to attract attention . </s>  " Ahem !  ahem !  "  he said ,  and everybody listened except the poor Catherine Wheel ,  who was still shaking her head ,  and murmuring ,   " Romance is dead . </s>  "   " Order !  order !  "  cried out a Cracker . </s>  He was something of a politician ,  and had always taken a prominent part in the local elections ,  so he knew the proper Parliamentary expressions to use . </s>  " Quite dead ,  "  whispered the Catherine Wheel ,  and she went off to sleep . As soon as there was perfect silence ,  the Rocket coughed a third time and began . </s>  He spoke with a very slow ,  distinct voice ,  as if he was dictating his memoirs ,  and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking . </s>  In fact ,  he had a most distinguished manner . </s>  " How fortunate it is for the King ' s son ,  "  he remarked ,   " that he is to be married on the very day on which I am to be let off . </s>  Really ,  if it had been arranged beforehand ,  it could not have turned out better for him ;  but ,  Princes are always lucky . </s>  "   " Dear me !  "  said the little Squib ,   " I thought it was quite the other way ,  and that we were to be let off in the Prince ' s honour . </s>  "   " It may be so with you ,  "  he answered ;   " indeed ,  I have no doubt that it is ,  but with me it is different . </s>  I am a very remarkable Rocket ,  and come of remarkable parents .

"  So all day long they travelled over meadows ,  fields ,  and stony roads . </s>  By the evening they came into a large forest ,  and laid themselves down in a hollow tree ,  and went to sleep . </s>  When they awoke the next morning ,  the sun had already risen high in the heavens ,  and its beams made the tree so hot that the little boy said to his sister ,   " I am so very thirsty ,  that if I knew where there was a brook ,  I would go and drink . </s>  Ah !  I think I hear one running ;  "  and so saying ,  he got up ,  and taking his Sister ' s hand they went to look for the brook . </s>  The wicked stepmother ,  however ,  was a witch ,  and had witnessed the departure of the two children :  so ,  sneaking after them secretly ,  as is the habit of witches ,  she had enchanted all the springs in the forest . </s>  Presently they found a brook ,  which ran trippingly over the pebbles ,  and the Brother would have drunk out of it ,  but the Sister heard how it said as it ran along ,   " Who drinks of me will become a tiger !  "  So the Sister exclaimed ,   " I pray you ,  Brother ,  drink not ,  or you will become a tiger ,  and tear me to pieces !  "  So the Brother did not drink ,  although his thirst was very great ,  and he said ,   " I will wait till the next brook . </s>  "  As they came to the second ,  the Sister heard it say ,   " Who drinks of me becomes a wolf !  "  The Sister ran up crying ,   " Brother ,  do not ,  pray do not drink ,  or you will become a wolf and eat me up !  "  Then the Brother did not drink ,  saying ,   " I will wait until we come to the next spring ,  but then I must drink ,  you may say what you will ;  my thirst is much too great . </s>  "  Just as they reached the third brook ,  the Sister heard the voice saying ,   " Who drinks of me will become a fawn -- who drinks of me will become a fawn !  "  So the Sister said ,   " Oh ,  my Brother do not drink ,  or you will be changed into a fawn ,  and run away from me !  "  But he had already kneeled down ,  and he drank of the water ,  and ,  as the first drops passed his lips ,  his shape took that of a fawn . </s>  At first the Sister wept over her little ,  changed Brother ,  and he wept too ,  and knelt by her ,  very sorrowful ;  but at last the maiden said ,   " Be still ,  dear little fawn ,  and I will never forsake you !  "  and ,  taking off her golden garter ,  she placed it around his neck ,  and ,  weaving rushes ,  made a girdle to lead him with . </s>  This she tied to him ,  and taking the other end in her hand ,  she led him away ,  and they travelled deeper and deeper into the forest . </s>  After they had gone a long distance they came to a little hut ,  and the maiden ,  peeping in ,  found it empty ,  and thought ,   " Here we can stay and dwell . </s>  "  Then she looked for leaves and moss to make a soft couch for the Fawn ,  and every morning she went out and collected roots and berries and nuts for herself ,  and tender grass for the Fawn . </s>  In the evening when the Sister was tired ,  and had said her prayers ,  she laid her head upon the back of the Fawn ,  which served for a pillow ,  on which she slept soundly . </s>  Had but the Brother regained his own proper form ,  their lives would have been happy indeed . </s>  Thus they dwelt in this wilderness ,  and some time had elapsed when it happened that the King of the country had a great hunt in the forest ;  and now sounded through the trees the blowing of horns ,  the barking of dogs ,  and the lusty cry of the hunters ,  so that the little Fawn heard them ,  and wanted very much to join in . </s>  " Ah !  "  said he to his Sister ,   " let me go to the hunt ,  I cannot restrain myself any longer ;  "  and he begged so hard that at last she consented . </s>  " But ,  "  she told him ,   " return again in the evening ,  for I shall shut my door against the wild huntsmen ,  and ,  that I may know you ,  do you knock ,  and say ,   ' Sister ,  dear ,  let me in ,  '  and if you do not speak I shall not open the door . </s>  "  As soon as she had said this ,  the little Fawn sprang off quite glad and merry in the fresh breeze . </s>  The King and his huntsmen perceived the beautiful animal ,  and pursued him ;  but they could not catch him ,  and when they thought they certainly had him ,  he sprang away over the bushes ,  and got out of sight . </s>  Just as it was getting dark ,  he ran up to the hut ,  and ,  knocking ,  said ,   " Sister mine ,  let me in . </s>  "  Then she unfastened the little door ,  and he went in ,  and rested all night long upon his soft couch . </s>  The next morning the hunt was commenced again ,  and as soon as the little Fawn heard the horns and the tally-ho of the sportsmen he could not rest ,  and said ,   " Sister ,  dear ,  open the door ;  I must be off . </s>  "  The Sister opened it ,  saying ,   " Return at evening ,  mind ,  and say the words as before . </s>  "  When the King and his huntsmen saw him again ,  the Fawn with the golden necklace ,  they followed him ,  close ,  but he was too nimble and quick for them . </s>  The whole day long they kept up with him ,  but towards evening the huntsmen made a circle around him ,  and one wounded him slightly in the hinder foot ,  so that he could run but slowly . </s>  Then one of them slipped after him to the little hut ,  and heard him say ,   " Sister ,  dear ,  open the door ,  "  and saw that the door was opened and immediately shut behind him . </s>  The huntsman ,  having observed all this ,  went and told the King what he had seen and heard ,  and he said ,   " On the morrow I will pursue him once again . </s>  "  The Sister ,  however ,  was terribly afraid when she saw that her Fawn was wounded ,  and ,  washing off the blood ,  she put herbs upon the foot ,  and said ,   " Go and rest upon your bed ,  dear Fawn ,  that your wound may heal . </s>  "  It was so slight ,  that the next morning he felt nothing of it ,  and when he heard the hunting cries outside ,  he exclaimed ,   " I cannot stop away -- I must be there ,  and none shall catch me so easily again !

How can we feed our children ,  when we have no more than we can eat ourselves ?  "   " Know ,  then ,  my husband ,  "  answered she ,   " we will lead them away ,  quite early in the morning ,  into the thickest part of the wood ,  and there make them a fire ,  and give them each a little piece of bread ;  then we will go to our work ,  and leave them alone ,  so they will not find the way home again ,  and we shall be freed from them . </s>  "   " No ,  wife ,  "  replied he ,   " that I can never do . </s>  How can you bring your heart to leave my children all alone in the wood ,  for the wild beasts will soon come and tear them to pieces ?

The next morning ,  before the sun arose ,  the wife went and awoke the two children . </s>  " Get up ,  you lazy things ;  we are going into the forest to chop wood . </s>  "  Then she gave them each a piece of bread ,  saying ,   " There is something for your dinner ;  do not eat it before the time ,  for you will get nothing else . </s>  "  Grethel took the bread in her apron ,  for Hansel ' s pocket was full of pebbles ;  and so they all set out upon their way . </s>  When they had gone a little distance ,  Hansel stood still ,  and peeped back at the house ;  and this he repeated several times ,  till his father said ,   " Hansel ,  what are you peeping at ,  and why do you lag behind ?

" My kingdom is large ,  and filled with fair cities . </s>  You have only to choose which you would prefer ,  to become its ruler to the end of your life . </s>  "   " Sire ,  "  answered the Indian ,  to whom the proposal did not seem nearly so generous as it appeared to the king ,   " I am most grateful to your Highness for your princely offer ,  and beseech you not to be offended with me if I say that I can only deliver up my horse in exchange for the hand of the princess your daughter . </s>  "  A shout of laughter burst from the courtiers as they heard these words ,  and Prince Firouz Schah ,  the heir apparent ,  was filled with anger at the Indian ' s presumption . </s>  The king ,  however ,  thought that it would not cost him much to part from the princess in order to gain such a delightful toy ,  and while he was hesitating as to his answer the prince broke in . </s>  " Sire ,  "  he said ,   " it is not possible that you can doubt for an instant what reply you should give to such an insolent bargain . </s>  Consider what you owe to yourself ,  and to the blood of your ancestors . </s>  "   " My son ,  "  replied the king ,   " you speak nobly ,  but you do not realise either the value of the horse ,  or the fact that if I reject the proposal of the Indian ,  he will only make the same to some other monarch ,  and I should be filled with despair at the thought that anyone but myself should own this Seventh Wonder of the World . </s>  Of course I do not say that I shall accept his conditions ,  and perhaps he may be brought to reason ,  but meanwhile I should like you to examine the horse ,  and ,  with the owner ' s permission ,  to make trial of its powers . </s>  "  The Indian ,  who had overheard the king ' s speech ,  thought that he saw in it signs of yielding to his proposal ,  so he joyfully agreed to the monarch ' s wishes ,  and came forward to help the prince to mount the horse ,  and show him how to guide it :   but ,  before he had finished ,  the young man turned the screw ,  and was soon out of sight . </s>  They waited some time ,  expecting that every moment he might be seen returning in the distance ,  but at length the Indian grew frightened ,  and prostrating himself before the throne ,  he said to the king ,   " Sire ,  your Highness must have noticed that the prince ,  in his impatience ,  did not allow me to tell him what it was necessary to do in order to return to the place from which he started . </s>  I implore you not to punish me for what was not my fault ,  and not to visit on me any misfortune that may occur . </s>  "   " But why ,  "  cried the king in a burst of fear and anger ,   " why did you not call him back when you saw him disappearing ?  "   " Sire ,  "  replied the Indian ,   " the rapidity of his movements took me so by surprise that he was out of hearing before I recovered my speech . </s>  But we must hope that he will perceive and turn a second screw ,  which will have the effect of bringing the horse back to earth . </s>  "   " But supposing he does !  "  answered the king ,   " what is to hinder the horse from descending straight into the sea ,  or dashing him to pieces on the rocks ?

"  said the old woman . </s>  " How did you get upon the large rapid river ,  to be driven about so in the wide world !

Every flower that one could think of ,  and of every season ,  stood there in fullest bloom ;  no picture-book could be gayer or more beautiful . </s>  Gerda jumped for joy ,  and played till the sun set behind the tall cherry-tree ;  she then had a pretty bed ,  with a red silken coverlet filled with blue violets . </s>  She fell asleep ,  and had as pleasant dreams as ever a queen on her wedding-day . </s>  The next morning she went to play with the flowers in the warm sunshine ,  and thus passed away a day . </s>  Gerda knew every flower ;  and ,  numerous as they were ,  it still seemed to Gerda that one was wanting ,  though she did not know which . </s>  One day while she was looking at the hat of the old woman painted with flowers ,  the most beautiful of them all seemed to her to be a rose . </s>  The old woman had forgotten to take it from her hat when she made the others vanish in the earth .

"  and she ran about amongst the flowerbeds ,  and looked ,  and looked ,  but there was not one to be found . </s>  She then sat down and wept ;  but her hot tears fell just where a rose-bush had sunk ;  and when her warm tears watered the ground ,  the tree shot up suddenly as fresh and blooming as when it had been swallowed up . </s>  Gerda kissed the roses ,  thought of her own dear roses at home ,  and with them of little Kay . " Oh ,  how long I have stayed !  "  said the little girl . </s>  " I intended to look for Kay !  Do not you know where he is ?  "  she asked of the roses .

But now you know him ,  and you know ,  too ,  how ill-behaved he is !  There was once a little girl who was very pretty and delicate ,  but in summer she was forced to run about with bare feet ,  she was so poor ,  and in winter wear very large wooden shoes ,  which made her little insteps quite red ,  and that looked so dangerous !  In the middle of the village lived old Dame Shoemaker ;  she sat and sewed together ,  as well as she could ,  a little pair of shoes out of old red strips of cloth ;  they were very clumsy ,  but it was a kind thought . </s>  They were meant for the little girl . The little girl was called Karen . On the very day her mother was buried ,  Karen received the red shoes ,  and wore them for the first time . </s>  They were certainly not intended for mourning ,  but she had no others ,  and with stockingless feet she followed the poor straw coffin in them . </s>  Suddenly a large old carriage drove up ,  and a large old lady sat in it :  she looked at the little girl ,  felt compassion for her ,  and then said to the clergyman :   " Here ,  give me the little girl . </s>  I will adopt her !  "  And Karen believed all this happened on account of the red shoes ,  but the old lady thought they were horrible ,  and they were burnt . </s>  But Karen herself was cleanly and nicely dressed ;  she must learn to read and sew ;  and people said she was a nice little thing ,  but the looking-glass said :   " Thou art more than nice ,  thou art beautiful !  "  Now the queen once travelled through the land ,  and she had her little daughter with her . </s>  And this little daughter was a princess ,  and people streamed to the castle ,  and Karen was there also ,  and the little princess stood in her fine white dress ,  in a window ,  and let herself be stared at ;  she had neither a train nor a golden crown ,  but splendid red morocco shoes . </s>  They were certainly far handsomer than those Dame Shoemaker had made for little Karen . Nothing in the world can be compared with red shoes . </s>  Now Karen was old enough to be confirmed ;  she had new clothes and was to have new shoes also . The rich shoemaker in the city took the measure of her little foot . </s>  This took place at his house ,  in his room ;  where stood large glass-cases ,  filled with elegant shoes and brilliant boots . </s>  All this looked charming ,  but the old lady could not see well ,  and so had no pleasure in them . </s>  In the midst of the shoes stood a pair of red ones ,  just like those the princess had worn . </s>  How beautiful they were !  The shoemaker said also they had been made for the child of a count ,  but had not fitted . " That must be patent leather !  "  said the old lady . </s>  " They shine so !  "   " Yes ,  they shine !  "  said Karen ,  and they fitted ,  and were bought ,  but the old lady knew nothing about their being red ,  else she would never have allowed Karen to have gone in red shoes to be confirmed . </s>  Yet such was the case . </s>  Everybody looked at her feet ;  and when she stepped through the chancel door on the church pavement ,  it seemed to her as if the old figures on the tombs ,  those portraits of old preachers and preachers '  wives ,  with stiff ruffs ,  and long black dresses ,  fixed their eyes on her red shoes . </s>  And she thought only of them as the clergyman laid his hand upon her head ,  and spoke of the holy baptism ,  of the covenant with God ,  and how she should be now a matured Christian ;  and the organ pealed so solemnly ;  the sweet children ' s voices sang ,  and the old music-directors sang ,  but Karen only thought of her red shoes . </s>  In the afternoon ,  the old lady heard from everyone that the shoes had been red ,  and she said that it was very wrong of Karen ,  that it was not at all becoming ,  and that in future Karen should only go in black shoes to church ,  even when she should be older . </s>  The next Sunday there was the sacrament ,  and Karen looked at the black shoes ,  looked at the red ones -- looked at them again ,  and put on the red shoes . </s>  The sun shone gloriously ;  Karen and the old lady walked along the path through the corn ;  it was rather dusty there . </s>  At the church door stood an old soldier with a crutch ,  and with a wonderfully long beard ,  which was more red than white ,  and he bowed to the ground ,  and asked the old lady whether he might dust her shoes . </s>  And Karen stretched out her little foot . " See ,  what beautiful dancing shoes !  "  said the soldier .

"  In Novgorod in the old days there was a young man -- just a boy he was -- the son of a rich merchant who had lost all his money and died . </s>  So Sadko was very poor . He had not a kopeck in the world ,  except what the people gave him when he played his dulcimer for their dancing . </s>  He had blue eyes and curling hair ,  and he was strong ,  and would have been merry ;  but it is dull work playing for other folk to dance ,  and Sadko dared not dance with any young girl ,  for he had no money to marry on ,  and he did not want to be chased away as a beggar . </s>  And the young women of Novgorod ,  they never looked at the handsome Sadko . </s>  No ;  they smiled with their bright eyes at the young men who danced with them ,  and if they ever spoke to Sadko ,  it was just to tell him sharply to keep the music going or to play faster . </s>  So Sadko lived alone with his dulcimer ,  and made do with half a loaf when he could not get a whole ,  and with crust when he had no crumb . </s>  He did not mind so very much what came to him ,  so long as he could play his dulcimer and walk along the banks of the little river Volkhov that flows by Novgorod ,  or on the shores of the lake ,  making music for himself ,  and seeing the pale mists rise over the water ,  and dawn or sunset across the shining river . </s>  " There is no girl in all Novgorod as pretty as my little river ,  "  he used to say ,  and night after night he would sit by the banks of the river or on the shores of the lake ,  playing the dulcimer and singing to himself . </s>  Sometimes he helped the fishermen on the lake ,  and they would give him a little fish for his supper in payment for his strong young arms . </s>  And it happened that one evening the fishermen asked him to watch their nets for them on the shore ,  while they went off to take their fish to sell them in the square at Novgorod . </s>  [ Footnote 1 :  The Volkhov would be a big river if it were in England ,  and Sadko and old Peter called it little only because they loved it . </s>  ]  Sadko sat on the shore ,  on a rock ,  and played his dulcimer and sang . </s>  Very sweetly he sang of the fair lake and the lovely river -- the little river that he thought prettier than all the girls of Novgorod . </s>  And while he was singing he saw a whirlpool in the lake ,  little waves flying from it across the water ,  and in the middle a hollow down into the water . </s>  And in the hollow he saw the head of a great man with blue hair and a gold crown . He knew that the huge man was the Tzar of the Sea . </s>  And the man came nearer ,  walking up out of the depths of the lake -- a huge ,  great man ,  a very giant ,  with blue hair falling to his waist over his broad shoulders . </s>  The little waves ran from him in all directions as he came striding up out of the water . </s>  Sadko did not know whether to run or stay ;  but the Tzar of the Sea called out to him in a great voice like wind and water in a storm ,  --   " Sadko of Novgorod ,  you have played and sung many days by the side of this lake and on the banks of the little river Volkhov . </s>  My daughters love your music ,  and it has pleased me too . Throw out a net into the water ,  and draw it in ,  and the waters will pay you for your singing . </s>  And if you are satisfied with the payment ,  you must come and play to us down in the green palace of the sea . </s>  "  With that the Tzar of the Sea went down again into the waters of the lake . </s>  The waves closed over him with a roar ,  and presently the lake was as smooth and calm as it had ever been . </s>  Sadko thought ,  and said to himself :   " Well ,  there is no harm done in casting out a net . "  So he threw a net out into the lake . </s>  He sat down again and played on his dulcimer and sang ,  and when he had finished his singing the dusk had fallen and the moon shone over the lake . </s>  He put down his dulcimer and took hold of the ropes of the net ,  and began to draw it up out of the silver water . </s>  Easily the ropes came ,  and the net ,  dripping and glittering in the moonlight . </s>  " I was dreaming ,  "  said Sadko ;   " I was asleep when I saw the Tzar of the Sea ,  and there is nothing in the net at all . </s>  "  And then ,  just as the last of the net was coming ashore ,  he saw something in it ,  square and dark . He dragged it out ,  and found it was a coffer . </s>  He opened the coffer ,  and it was full of precious stones -- green ,  red ,  gold -- gleaming in the light of the moon . Diamonds shone there like little bundles of sharp knives . </s>  " There can be no harm in taking these stones ,  "  says Sadko ,   " whether I dreamed or not . </s>  "  He took the coffer on his shoulder ,  and bent under the weight of it ,  strong though he was . He put it in a safe place . </s>  All night he sat and watched by the nets ,  and played and sang ,  and planned what he would do . </s>  In the morning the fishermen came ,  laughing and merry after their night in Novgorod ,  and they gave him a little fish for watching their nets ;  and he made a fire on the shore ,  and cooked it and ate it as he used to do . </s>  " And that is my last meal as a poor man ,  "  says Sadko . </s>  " Ah me !  who knows if I shall be happier ?  "  Then he set the coffer on his shoulder and tramped away for Novgorod . " Who is that ?  "  they asked at the gates . </s>  " Only Sadko the dulcimer player ,  "  he replied . " Turned porter ?  "  said they . " One trade is as good as another ,  "  said Sadko ,  and he walked into the city . </s>  He sold a few of the stones ,  two at a time ,  and with what he got for them he set up a booth in the market . </s>  Small things led to great ,  and he was soon one of the richest traders in Novgorod . And now there was not a girl in the town who could look too sweetly at Sadko . </s>  " He has golden hair ,  "  says one . " Blue eyes like the sea ,  "  says another . " He could lift the world on his shoulders ,  "  says a third . </s>  A little money ,  you see ,  opens everybody ' s eyes . But Sadko was not changed by his good fortune . Still he walked and played by the little river Volkhov . </s>  When work was done and the traders gone ,  Sadko would take his dulcimer and play and sing on the banks of the river . </s>  And still he said ,   " There is no girl in all Novgorod as pretty as my little river . </s>  "  Every time he came back from his long voyages -- for he was trading far and near ,  like the greatest of merchants -- he went at once to the banks of the river to see how his sweetheart fared . </s>  And always he brought some little present for her and threw it into the waves . </s>  For twelve years he lived unmarried in Novgorod ,  and every year made voyages ,  buying and selling ,  and always growing richer and richer . </s>  Many were the mothers in Novgorod who would have liked to see him married to their daughters . </s>  Many were the pillows that were wet with the tears of the young girls ,  as they thought of the blue eyes of Sadko and his golden hair . </s>  And then ,  in the twelfth year since he walked into Novgorod with the coffer on his shoulder ,  he was sailing in a ship on the Caspian Sea ,  far ,  far away . </s>  For many days the ship sailed on ,  and Sadko sat on deck and played his dulcimer and sang of Novgorod and of the little river Volkhov that flows under the walls of the town .

"  asked Vanya . " Alive ,  "  said old Peter . " Is there a lot of it ?  "  asked Vanya . " No ,  only one . </s>  "   " Then it ca not be pigs ,  "  said Vanya ,  in a melancholy voice . " I thought it was pigs . "   " Perhaps it is a little calf ,  "  said Maroosia . </s>  " I know what it is ,  "  said Vanya . " Well ?  "   " It ' s a foal . </s>  It ' s brown all over with white on its nose ,  and a lot of white hairs in its tail . "   " No . </s>  "   " What is it then ,  grandfather ?  "   " I will tell you ,  little pigeons . </s>  It ' s small and red ,  and it ' s got a bumpy head with hair on it like the fluff of a duckling . </s>  It has blue eyes ,  and ten fingers to its fore paws ,  and ten toes to its hind feet -- five to each . "   " It ' s a baby ,  "  said Maroosia . " Yes . </s>  Nastasia has got a little son ,  Aunt Sofia has got a grandson ,  you have got a new cousin ,  and I have got a new great-nephew . </s>  Think of that !  Already it ' s a son ,  and a cousin ,  and a grandson ,  and a great-nephew ,  and he ' s only been alive twelve hours . </s>  He lost no time in taking a position for himself . He will be a great man one of these days if he goes on as fast as that . </s>  "  The children had jumped up as soon as they knew it was a baby . " When is the christening ?  "   " The day after to-morrow . </s>  "   " O grandfather !  "   " Well ?  "   " Who is going to the christening ?  "   " The baby ,  of course . </s>  "   " Yes ;  but other people ?  "   " All the village . </s>  "   " And us ?  "   " I have to go ,  and I suppose there will be room in the cart for two little bear cubs like you . </s>  "  And so it was settled that Vanya and Maroosia were to go to the christening of their new cousin ,  who was only twelve hours old . </s>  All the next day they could think of nothing else ,  and early on the morning of the christening they were up and about ,  Maroosia seeing that Vanya had on a clean shirt ,  and herself putting a green ribbon in her hair . </s>  The sun shone ,  and the leaves on the trees were all new and bright ,  and the sky was pale blue through the flickering green leaves . </s>  Old Peter was up early too ,  harnessing the little yellow horse into the old cart . </s>  The cart was of rough wood ,  without springs ,  like a big box fixed on long larch poles between two pairs of wheels . </s>  The larch poles did instead of springs ,  bending and creaking ,  as the cart moved over the forest track . </s>  The shafts came from the front wheels upwards to the horse ' s shoulders ,  and between the ends of them there was a tall strong hoop of wood ,  called a douga ,  which rose high over the shoulders of the horse ,  above his collar ,  and had two little bells hanging from it at the top . </s>  The wooden hoop was painted green with little red flowers . The harness was mostly of ropes ,  but that did not matter so long as it held together . </s>  The horse had a long tail and mane ,  and looked as untidy as a little boy ;  but he had a green ribbon in his forelock in honour of the christening ,  and he could go like anything ,  and never got tired . </s>  When all was ready ,  old Peter arranged a lot of soft fresh hay in the cart for the children to sit in . </s>  Hay is the best thing in the world to sit in when you drive in a jolting Russian cart . </s>  Old Peter put in a tremendous lot ,  so that the horse could eat some of it while waiting in the village ,  and yet leave them enough to make them comfortable on the journey back . </s>  Finally ,  old Peter took a gun that he had spent all the evening before in cleaning ,  and laid it carefully in the hay . " What is the gun for ?  "  asked Vanya . </s>  " I am to be a godparent ,  "  said old Peter ,   " and I want to give him a present . </s>  I could not give him a better present than a gun ,  for he shall be a forester ,  and a good shot ,  and you cannot begin too early . </s>  "  Presently Vanya and Maroosia were tucked into the hay ,  and old Peter climbed in with the plaited reins ,  and away they went along the narrow forest track ,  where the wheels followed the ruts and splashed through the deep holes ;  for the spring was young ,  and the roads had not yet dried . </s>  Some of the deepest holes had a few pine branches laid in them ,  but that was the only road-mending that ever was done . </s>  Overhead were the tall firs and silver birches with their little pale round leaves ;  and somewhere ,  not far away ,  a cuckoo was calling ,  while the murmur of the wild pigeons never stopped for a moment . </s>  They drove on and on through the forest ,  and at last came out from among the trees into the open country ,  a broad ,  flat plain stretching to the river . </s>  Far away they could see the big square sail of a boat ,  swelled out in the light wind ,  and they knew that there was the river ,  on the banks of which stood the village . </s>  They could see a small clump of trees ,  and ,  as they came nearer ,  the pale green cupolas of the white village church rising above the tops of the birches . </s>  Presently they came to a rough wooden bridge ,  and crossed over a little stream that was on its way to join the big river . Vanya looked at it . </s>  " Grandfather ,  "  he asked ,   " when the frost went ,  which was water first -- the big river or the little river ?  "   " Why ,  the little river ,  of course ,  "  said old Peter . </s>  " It ' s always the little streams that wake first in the spring ,  and running down to the big river make it swell and flood and break up the ice . </s>  It ' s always been so ever since the quarrel between the Vazouza and the Volga . "   " What was that ?  "  said Vanya . " It was like this ,  "  said old Peter . </s>  The Vazouza and the Volga flow for a long way side by side ,  and then they join and flow together . </s>  And the Vazouza is a little river ;  but the Volga is the mother of all Russia ,  and the greatest river in the world . And the little Vazouza was jealous of the Volga . </s>  " You are big and noisy ,  "  she says to the Volga ,   " and terribly strong ;  but as for brains ,  "  says she ,   " why ,  I have more brains in a single ripple than you in all that lump of water . </s>  "  Of course the Volga told her not to be so rude ,  and said that little rivers should know their place and not argue with the great . </s>  But the Vazouza would not keep quiet ,  and at last she said to the Volga :   " Look here ,  we will lie down and sleep ,  and we will agree that the one of us who wakes first and comes first to the sea is the wiser of the two . </s>  "  And the Volga said ,   " Very well ,  if only you will stop talking . </s>  "  So the little Vazouza and the big Volga lay and slept ,  white and still ,  all through the winter . </s>  And when the spring came ,  the little Vazouza woke first ,  brisk and laughing and hurrying ,  and rushed away as hard as she could go towards the sea .

Anticipating no good ,  my brother commanded the oarsmen to turn the vessel ,  and make for land . </s>  His apprehensions seemed ,  indeed ,  to be confirmed ,  for the boat quickly approached that of my brother ,  and getting ahead of it ,   ( for it had more rowers ,  )  ran between it and the land . </s>  The young girls ,  moreover ,  when they knew the danger to which they were exposed ,  sprang up with cries and lamentations :  in vain Mustapha sought to quiet them ,  in vain enjoined upon them to be still ,  lest their running to and fro should upset the vessel . </s>  It was of no avail ;  and when ,  in consequence of the proximity of the other boat ,  all ran upon the further side ,  it was upset . </s>  Meanwhile ,  they had observed from the land the approach of the strange boat ,  and ,  inasmuch as ,  for some time back ,  they had been in anxiety on account of Corsairs ,  their suspicions were excited ,  and several boats put off from the land to their assistance :  but they only came in time to pick up the drowning . </s>  In the confusion ,  the hostile boat escaped . In both barks ,  however ,  which had taken in those who were preserved ,  they were uncertain whether all had been saved . </s>  They approached each other ,  and ,  alas !  found that my sister and one of her companions were missing ;  at the same time ,  in their number a stranger was discovered ,  who was known to none . </s>  In answer to Mustapha ' s threats ,  he confessed that he belonged to the hostile ship ,  which was lying at anchor two miles to the eastward ,  and that his companions had left him behind in their hasty flight ,  while he was engaged in assisting to pick up the maidens ;  moreover ,  he said he had seen two taken on board their boat . </s>  The grief of my old father was without bounds ,  but Mustapha also was afflicted unto death ,  for not only had his beloved sister been lost ,  and did he accuse himself of having been the cause of her misfortune ,  but ,  also ,  her companion who had shared it with her ,  had been promised to him by her parents as his wife ;  still had he not dared to avow it to our father ,  because her family was poor ,  and of low descent . </s>  My father ,  however ,  was a stern man ;  as soon as his sorrow had subsided a little ,  he called Mustapha before him ,  and thus spake to him :  --   " Thy folly has deprived me of the consolation of my old age ,  and the joy of my eyes . </s>  Go !  I banish thee forever from my sight !  I curse thee and thine offspring -- and only when thou shalt restore to me my Fatima ,  shall thy head be entirely free from a father ' s execrations !  "  This my poor brother had not expected ;  already ,  before this ,  he had determined to go in search of his sister and her friend ,  after having asked the blessing of his father upon his efforts ,  and now that father had sent him forth into the world ,  laden with his curse . </s>  As ,  however ,  his former grief had bowed him down ,  so this consummation of misfortune ,  which he had not deserved ,  tended to steel his mind . </s>  He went to the imprisoned pirate ,  and ,  demanding whither the ship was bound ,  learned that she carried on a trade in slaves ,  and usually had a great sale thereof in Balsora . </s>  On his return to the house ,  in order to prepare for his journey ,  the anger of his father seemed to have subsided a little ,  for he sent him a purse full of gold ,  to support him during his travels . </s>  Mustapha ,  thereupon ,  in tears took leave of the parents of Zoraida ,   ( for so his affianced was called ,  )  and set out upon the route to Balsora . </s>  Mustapha travelled by land ,  because from our little city there was no ship that went direct to Balsora . </s>  He was obliged ,  therefore ,  to use all expedition ,  in order not to arrive too long after the sea-robbers . </s>  Having a good horse and no luggage ,  he hoped to reach this city by the end of the sixth day . </s>  On the evening of the fourth ,  however ,  as he was riding all alone upon his way ,  three men came suddenly upon him . </s>  Having observed that they were well-armed and powerful men ,  and sought his money and his horse ,  rather than his life ,  he cried out that he would yield himself to them . </s>  They dismounted ,  and tied his feet together under his horse ;  then they placed him in their midst ,  and ,  without a word spoken ,  trotted quickly away with him ;  one of them having seized his bridle . </s>  Mustapha gave himself up to a feeling of gloomy despair ;  the curse of his father seemed already to be undergoing its accomplishment on the unfortunate one ,  and how could he hope to save his sister and Zoraida ,  should he ,  robbed of all his means ,  even be able to devote his poor life to their deliverance ?  Mustapha and his silent companions might have ridden about an hour ,  when they entered a little valley . </s>  The vale was enclosed by lofty trees ;  a soft ,  dark-green turf ,  and a stream which ran swiftly through its midst ,  invited to repose . </s>  In this place were pitched from fifteen to twenty tents ,  to the stakes of which were fastened camels and fine horses :  from one of these tents distinctly sounded the melody of a guitar ,  blended with two fine manly voices . </s>  It seemed to my brother as if people who had chosen so blithesome a resting-place ,  could have no evil intentions towards himself ;  and accordingly ,  without apprehension ,  he obeyed the summons of his conductors ,  who had unbound his feet ,  and made signs to him to follow . </s>  They led him into a tent which was larger than the rest ,  and on the inside was magnificently fitted up . </s>  Splendid cushions embroidered with gold ,  woven carpets ,  gilded censers ,  would elsewhere have bespoken opulence and respectability ,  but here seemed only the booty of a robber band . </s>  Upon one of the cushions an old and small-sized man was reclining :  his countenance was ugly ;  a dark-brown and shining skin ,  a disgusting expression around his eyes ,  and a mouth of malicious cunning ,  combined to render his whole appearance odious . </s>  Although this man sought to put on a commanding air ,  still Mustapha soon perceived that not for him was the tent so richly adorned ,  and the conversation of his conductors seemed to confirm him in his opinion . </s>  " Where is the Mighty ?  "  inquired they of the little man . " He is out upon a short hunt ,  "  was the answer ;   " but he has commissioned me to attend to his affairs . </s>  "   " That has he not wisely done ,  "  rejoined one of the robbers ;   " for it must soon be determined whether this dog is to die or be ransomed ,  and that the Mighty knows better than thou .

Once ,  when her father was away from home ,  her step-sisters went off to a wedding dance . </s>  They told her not to forget to draw water from the well ,  and warned her that if she forgot ,  as she did the last time ,  they would beat her without mercy when they returned . </s>  So Rosy-red ,  tired though she was ,  went out in the darkness to draw water . She lowered the bucket ,  but the cord broke and the pail fell to the bottom of the well . </s>  She ran back home for a long stick with a hook at the end of it to recover the bucket ,  and as she put it into the water she sang :      Swing and sweep till all does cling     And to the surface safely bring . </s>  Now it so happened that a sleeping jinn dwelt at the bottom of the well . </s>  He could only be awakened by a spell ,  and although Rosy-red did not know it ,  the words she uttered ,  which she had once heard her granny use ,  were the spell . </s>  The jinn awoke ,  and he was so delighted with the sweet voice that he promptly decided to help the girl whom he saw peering down into the water . </s>  He fastened the bucket to the stick and ,  taking some jewels from a treasure of which he was the guardian ,  he put them inside . </s>  " Oh ,  how beautiful ,  "  cried Rosy-red when she saw the glittering gems .

"  Rosy-red was too much taken by surprise to say anything . </s>  It was an outrage to turn her out of her father ' s house while he was away on a journey ,  but the thought came to her that she could hardly be less happy living alone in the woods . </s>  She had only time to snatch her pretty red slippers ,  and as soon as she was out of sight of the house she put them on . It made her feel less miserable . </s>  The sun was now rising and when its rays shone on her she began to sing . With her old friends ,  the birds ,  twittering all about her ,  she felt quite happy . </s>  On and on she walked ,  much farther into the woods than ever before . </s>  When she grew tired there was always a pleasant shady nook where she could rest ;  when she became hungry ,  there were fruit trees in abundance ;  and when she was thirsty she always came to a spring of clear ,  fresh water . </s>  The magic slippers guided her .

Despite all this ,  Princess Solima was not happy . </s>  Indeed ,  she was wretched to despondency ,  and her melancholy weighed heavily upon her father . " What ails you ,  my precious daughter ?  "  he asked her a hundred times ,  but she made no answer . </s>  She just sat and silently moped . She did not waste away ,  which puzzled the physicians ;  she did not grow pale ,  which surprised her attendants ;  and she did not weep ,  which astonished herself . </s>  But she felt as if her heart had grown heavy ,  as if there was no use in anything . </s>  The king squared his shoulders to show his determination and summoned his magicians and wizards and sorcerers and commanded them to perform their arts and solve the mystery of the illness of Princess Solima . </s>  A strange crew they were ,  ranged in a semi-circle before the king . </s>  There was the renowned astrologer from Egypt ,  a little man with a humpback ;  the mixer of mysterious potions from China ,  a long ,  lank yellow man ,  with tiny eyes ;  the alchemist from Arabia ,  a scowling man with his face almost concealed by whiskers ;  there was a Greek and a Persian and a Phoenician ,  each with some special knowledge and fearfully anxious to display it . </s>  They set to work . </s>  One studied the stars ,  another concocted a sweet-smelling fluid ,  a third retired to the woods and thought deeply ,  a fourth made abstruse calculations with diagrams and figures ,  a fifth questioned the princess '  handmaidens ,  and a sixth conceived the brilliant notion of talking with the princess herself . </s>  He was certainly an original wizard ,  and he learned more than all the others . Then they met in consultation and talked foreign languages and pretended very seriously to understand one another . </s>  One said the stars were in opposition ,  another said he had gazed into a crystal and had seen a glow-worm chasing a hippopotamus which a third interpreted as meaning the princess would die if the glow-worm won the race . </s>  " Rubbish !  "  exclaimed the magician who had spoken to the princess ;   " likewise stuff and nonsense and the equivalent thereof in the seventy unknown languages . </s>  "  That was an impertinent comment on their divinations ,  and so they listened seriously . " The princess ,  "  he said ,   " is just tired . </s>  That is a disease which will become popular and fashionable as the world grows older and more people amass riches . </s>  She is sick of being waited on hand and foot and bowed down to and all that sort of thing . </s>  She has never been allowed to romp as a child ,  to choose her own companions and the rest of it . Therefore ,  she is bored with all the etcetras . </s>  The case is comprehensible and comprehensive :  it needs the exercise of imagination stimulated by prescience ,  conscience ,  patience . . . . </s>  "  The others yawned and began to collect dictionaries ,  and fearing that they might be tempted to fling them at him after they had found the meaning of his big words ,  he ceased . </s>  " I agree ,  "  said the president of the assembly ,  the oldest wizard ,   " only I diagnose the disease in simpler form . The princess is in love . </s>  "  That set them all jabbering together ,  and they finally agreed to report to the king that the time had arrived when the princess should marry ,  so that she should be able to go away to a new land ,  amid other people and different scenes . </s>  The king agreed reluctantly ,  for he dearly loved his daughter and wished her to remain with him always if possible . </s>  Heralds and messengers were sent out far and wide ,  and very soon a procession of suitors for the princess '  hand began to file past the lady . </s>  They were princes of all shapes and sizes ,  of all complexions and colors ;  some were resplendent with jewels ,  others were followed by retinues of slaves bearing gifts ;  a few entered the competition by proxy -- that is ,  they sent somebody else to see the lady first and pronounce judgment upon her . </s>  These she dismissed summarily ,  declaring that they were disqualified by the rules of fair play . </s>  When all the entrants had been inspected by the king ,  he said to his daughter :   " Pick the one you love the best ,  Solima dear . "   " None ,  "  she answered promptly . </s>  " Dear ,  dear me -- that is very awkward . We shall have to return the entrance fees -- I mean the presents ,  "  he said . </s>  That prospect did not seem to worry the princess in the least ;  nor did her father ' s appeal not to belittle him in the eyes of his fellow monarchs have the slightest effect on her . </s>  " At least ,  "  he said ,  growing impatient ,   " tell me what you do want . </s>  "   " I will marry any man ,  "  she replied ,  while he wondered gravely what else she could have said ,   " who is not such a fool as to think himself the only person in the world who is of consequence . </s>  "  The king was not without wisdom ,  and he knew that this remark is foolish ,  or sensible ,  according to the mood in which it is said ,  and the thoughts behind it . </s>  " You do not regard any one of the princes ,  "  the king said gently ,   " as worthy of --  --  "   " Any woman ,  "  interrupted his daughter . </s>  " Listen ,  my father ,  you have tried to make me happy always and until recently you have succeeded . I wish to obey you in all things ,  even in the choice of a husband . </s>  Would you really have me marry any one of these fools ?  Be not angry . </s>  Did any one reveal a gleam of wisdom ,  or common-sense ?  Were they not all just ridiculous fops ?  Let me enumerate :   " There was Prince Hafiz who talked only of his wars -- of the men -- aye and women and children -- his soldiers had butchered . </s>  The soldiers fought and Prince Hafiz posed before me as a warrior and hero . I will not be queen in a land where people cannot live in peace . </s>  " Then there was Prince Aziz who boasted that he spends all his life with his horses and dogs and falcons in the hunting field . He knows the needs of beasts ,  but not of men . </s>  I will not be the bride of a prince who allows his subjects to starve in wretchedness and poverty while he enjoys himself with the slaughter of wild beasts . </s>  " Prince Guzman had nothing else to impart to me but his taste in jewels and dress . </s>  Prince Abdul knew exactly how many bottles of wine he drank daily ,  but he could not tell me how many schools there were in his city . </s>  Prince Hassan had not the slightest notion how the majority of his people lived ,  whether by trading ,  or thieving ,  or working ,  or begging . "  King Zuliman listened intently . </s>  This was a singular speech for a princess ,  but reason told him this was profoundest wisdom . " Oh ,  I am tired ,  "  burst out Princess Solima ,  in tears . </s>  " I have no desire for life if to be a ruler over men and women and children means that you must take no interest in their welfare . My father ,  hearken . </s>  I will not be queen in a land where the king thinks the people live only to make him great . </s>  I shall be proud and happy to reign where the king understands that it is his duty to make his people happy and his country prosperous and peaceful . </s>  "  The king left his daughter ,  and ,  deeply concerned ,  sought his wizards . " My daughter has been born thousands of years before her time ,  "  he declared ,  petulantly . </s>  " The stars have played a trick on me ,  and have sent me my great-great-great-great ever so much great granddaughter out of her turn . </s>  "  The magicians did not laugh at this :  they thought it a wonderfully sage remark ,  and after much mysterious whispering among themselves and consultation of old books ,  and gazing into crystals ,  they informed the king that the stars foretold that Princess Solima would marry a poor man !

"  asked the boy . </s>  " Yes ,  if you can tell me as nearly as possible how deep is the gutter in the little street where you go to school . </s>  "   " Just half as high as my top-boots ,  "  replied the boy ;   " but then I must stand in the deepest holes . </s>  "   " There ,  now we know where you got your wet feet ,  "  said the old man . </s>  " I ought to tell you a story ,  but the worst of it is ,  I do not know any more .

"  asked the boy ;  and the mother smiled while she put elder-tree blossoms into the teapot and poured boiling water over them . </s>  " Pray ,  tell me a story .

Look at the teapot ;  there is a story in it now . </s>  "  And the little boy looked at the teapot ;  the lid rose up gradually ,  the elder-tree blossoms sprang forth one by one ,  fresh and white ;  long boughs came forth ;  even out of the spout they grew up in all directions ,  and formed a bush -- nay ,  a large elder tree ,  which stretched its branches up to the bed and pushed the curtains aside ;  and there were so many blossoms and such a sweet fragrance !  In the midst of the tree sat a kindly-looking old woman with a strange dress ;  it was as green as the leaves ,  and trimmed with large white blossoms ,  so that it was difficult to say whether it was real cloth ,  or the leaves and blossoms of the elder-tree . </s>  " What is this woman ' s name ?  "  asked the little boy . </s>  " Well ,  the Romans and Greeks used to call her a Dryad ,  "  said the old man ;   " but we do not understand that . </s>  Out in the sailors '  quarter they give her a better name ;  there she is called elder-tree mother . Now ,  you must attentively listen to her and look at the beautiful elder-tree . </s>  " Just such a large tree ,  covered with flowers ,  stands out there ;  it grew in the corner of an humble little yard ;  under this tree sat two old people one afternoon in the beautiful sunshine . </s>  He was an old ,  old sailor ,  and she his old wife ;  they had already great-grandchildren ,  and were soon to celebrate their golden wedding ,  but they could not remember the date ,  and the elder-tree mother was sitting in the tree and looked as pleased as this one here . </s>  ' I know very well when the golden wedding is to take place ,  '  she said ;  but they did not hear it -- they were talking of bygone days . </s>  "  ' Well ,  do you remember ?  '  said the old sailor ,   ' when we were quite small and used to run about and play -- it was in the very same yard where we now are -- we used to put little branches into the ground and make a garden . </s>  '   "  ' Yes ,  '  said the old woman ,   ' I remember it very well ;  we used to water the branches ,  and one of them ,  an elder-tree branch ,  took root ,  and grew and became the large tree under which we are now sitting as old people . </s>  '   "  ' Certainly ,  you are right ,  '  he said ;   ' and in yonder corner stood a large water-tub ;  there I used to sail my boat ,  which I had cut out myself -- it sailed so well ;  but soon I had to sail somewhere else . </s>  '   "  ' But first we went to school to learn something ,  '  she said ,   ' and then we were confirmed ;  we both wept on that day ,  but in the afternoon we went out hand in hand ,  and ascended the high round tower and looked out into the wide world right over Copenhagen and the sea ;  then we walked to Fredericksburg ,  where the king and the queen were sailing about in their magnificent boat on the canals . </s>  '   "  ' But soon I had to sail about somewhere else ,  and for many years I was travelling about far away from home . </s>  '   "  ' And I often cried about you ,  for I was afraid lest you were drowned and lying at the bottom of the sea . </s>  Many a time I got up in the night and looked if the weathercock had turned ;  it turned often ,  but you did not return . </s>  I remember one day distinctly :  the rain was pouring down in torrents ;  the dust-man had come to the house where I was in service ;  I went down with the dust-bin and stood for a moment in the doorway ,  and looked at the dreadful weather . </s>  Then the postman gave me a letter ;  it was from you . Heavens !  how that letter had travelled about . </s>  I tore it open and read it ;  I cried and laughed at the same time ,  and was so happy !  Therein was written that you were staying in the hot countries ,  where the coffee grows . </s>  These must be marvellous countries . You said a great deal about them ,  and I read all while the rain was pouring down and I was standing there with the dust-bin . </s>  Then suddenly some one put his arm round my waist- '   "  ' Yes ,  and you gave him a hearty smack on the cheek ,  '  said the old man . </s>  "  ' I did not know that it was you -- you had come as quickly as your letter ;  and you looked so handsome ,  and so you do still . </s>  You had a large yellow silk handkerchief in your pocket and a shining hat on . </s>  You looked so well ,  and the weather in the street was horrible !  '   "  ' Then we married ,  '  he said . </s>  ' Do you remember how we got our first boy ,  and then Mary ,  Niels ,  Peter ,  John ,  and Christian ?

' Yes ,  these are children ' s children ,  and they are strong and healthy . </s>  If I am not mistaken ,  our wedding took place at this season of the year . </s>  '   "  ' Yes ,  to-day is your golden wedding-day ,  '  said the little elder-tree mother ,  stretching her head down between the two old people ,  who thought that she was their neighbour who was nodding to them ;  they looked at each other and clasped hands . </s>  Soon afterwards the children and grandchildren came ,  for they knew very well that it was the golden wedding-day ;  they had already wished them joy and happiness in the morning ,  but the old people had forgotten it ,  although they remembered things so well that had passed many ,  many years ago .

'   ' But surely a person of your talents must perceive that you might eat me to the very last morsel and never know that you had swallowed anything at all !

'   ' If you were only to see the quantities of them !  '  laughed the fox . </s>  ' And even if they were finished ,  there would always be ME to eat . '   ' Well ,  I will come . </s>  Lead the way ,  but I warn you that if you try to escape or play any tricks you are reckoning without your host --  that is to say ,  without my legs ,  which are as long as yours !  '  All was silent in the village ,  and not a light was to be seen but that of the moon ,  which shone bright and clear in the sky . </s>  The wolf and the fox crept softly along ,  when suddenly they stopped and looked at each other ;  a savoury smell of frying bacon reached their noses ,  and reached the noses of the sleeping dogs ,  who began to bark greedily . </s>  ' Is it safe to go on ,  think you ?  '  asked the wolf in a whisper .

' Spare me a morsel ,  Ardan son of Gorla ,  '  asked a raven ,  fluttering down towards him . </s>  ' Seek food elsewhere ,  O bearer of ill-news ,  '  answered Ardan son of Gorla ;   ' it is but little I have for myself . </s>  '   And he stretched himself out for a few moments ,  then rose to his feet again . </s>  On and on went he till the little birds flew to their nests ,  and the brightness died out of the sky ,  and a darkness fell over the earth . </s>  On and on ,  and on ,  till at last he saw a beam of light streaming from a house and hastened towards it . </s>  The door was opened and he entered ,  but paused when he beheld an old man lying on a bench by the fire ,  while seated opposite him was a maiden combing out the locks of her golden hair with a comb of silver . </s>  ' Welcome ,  fair youth ,  '  said the old man ,  turning his head .

' I want to fish too ,  '  cried the wolf . </s>  But the mink said nothing and pretended not to hear . </s>  ' I wish you would take me into your boat !  '  shouted the wolf ,  louder than before ,  and he continued to beseech the mink so long that at last he grew tired of it ,  and paddled to the shore close enough for the wolf to jump in . </s>  ' Sit down quietly at that end or we shall be upset ,  '  said the mink ;   ' and if you care about sea-urchins '  eggs ,  you will find plenty in that basket . </s>  But be sure you eat only the white ones ,  for the red ones would kill you . </s>  '  So the wolf ,  who was always hungry ,  began to eat the eggs greedily ;  and when he had finished he told the mink he thought he would have a nap . </s>  ' Well ,  then ,  stretch yourself out ,  and rest your head on that piece of wood ,  '  said the mink . And the wolf did as he was bid ,  and was soon fast asleep . </s>  Then the mink crept up to him and stabbed him to the heart with his knife ,  and he died without moving . </s>  After that he landed on the beach ,  skinned the wolf ,  and taking the skin to his cottage ,  he hung it up before the fire to dry . </s>  Not many days later the wolf ' s grandmother ,  who ,  with the help of her relations ,  had been searching for him everywhere ,  entered the cottage to buy some sea-urchins '  eggs ,  and saw the skin ,  which she at once guessed to be that of her grandson . </s>  ' I knew he was dead -- I knew it !   I knew it !  '  she cried ,  weeping bitterly ,  till the mink told her rudely that if she wanted to make so much noise she had better do it outside as he liked to be quiet . </s>  So ,  half-blinded by her tears ,  the old woman went home the way she had come ,  and running in at the door ,  she flung herself down in front of the fire . </s>  ' What are you crying for ?  '  asked the old wolf and some friends who had been spending the afternoon with him . ' I shall never see my grandson any more !  '  answered she . </s>  ' Mink has killed him ,  oh !  oh !  '   And putting her head down ,  she began to weep as loudly as ever . </s>  ' There !  there !  '  said her husband ,  laying his paw on her shoulder . ' Be comforted ;  if he IS dead ,  we will avenge him . </s>  '   And calling to the others they proceeded to talk over the best plan . </s>  It took them a long time to make up their minds ,  as one wolf proposed one thing and one another ;  but at last it was agreed that the old wolf should give a great feast in his house ,  and that the mink should be invited to the party . </s>  And in order that no time should be lost it was further agreed that each wolf should bear the invitations to the guests that lived nearest to him . </s>  Now the wolves thought they were very cunning ,  but the mink was more cunning still ;  and though he sent a message by a white hare ,  that was going that way ,  saying he should be delighted to be present ,  he determined that he would take his precautions . </s>  So he went to a mouse who had often done him a good turn ,  and greeted her with his best bow . </s>  ' I have a favour to ask of you ,  friend mouse ,  '  said he ,   ' and if you will grant it I will carry you on my back every night for a week to the patch of maize right up the hill . </s>  '   ' The favour is mine ,  '  answered the mouse . ' Tell me what it is that I can have the honour of doing for you . </s>  '   ' Oh ,  something quite easy ,  '  replied the mink . </s>  ' I only want you -- between to-day and the next full moon -- to gnaw through the bows and paddles of the wolf people ,  so that directly they use them they will break . </s>  But of course you must manage it so that they notice nothing . </s>  '   ' Of course ,  '  answered the mouse ,   ' nothing is easier ;  but as the full moon is to-morrow night ,  and there is not much time ,  I had better begin at once . </s>  '   Then the mink thanked her ,  and went his way ;  but before he had gone far he came back again . </s>  ' Perhaps ,  while you are about the wolf ' s house seeing after the bows ,  it would do no harm if you were to make that knot-hole in the wall a little bigger ,  '  said he . </s>  ' Not large enough to draw attention ,  of course ;  but it might come in handy . '   And with another nod he left her . </s>  The next evening the mink washed and brushed himself carefully and set out for the feast . </s>  He smiled to himself as he looked at the dusty track ,  and perceived that though the marks of wolves '  feet were many ,  not a single guest was to be seen anywhere . </s>  He knew very well what that meant ;  but he had taken his precautions and was not afraid . </s>  The house door stood open ,  but through a crack the mink could see the wolves crowding in the corner behind it . </s>  However ,  he entered boldly ,  and as soon as he was fairly inside the door was shut with a bang ,  and the whole herd sprang at him ,  with their red tongues hanging out of their mouths . </s>  Quick as they were they were too late ,  for the mink was already through the knot-hole and racing for his canoe . </s>  The knot-hole was too small for the wolves ,  and there were so many of them in the hut that it was some time before they could get the door open . </s>  Then they seized the bows and arrows which were hanging on the walls and ,  once outside ,  aimed at the flying mink ;  but as they pulled the bows broke in their paws ,  so they threw them away ,  and bounded to the shore ,  with all their speed ,  to the place where their canoes were drawn up on the beach . </s>  Now ,  although the mink could not run as fast as the wolves ,  he had a good start ,  and was already afloat when the swiftest among them threw themselves into the nearest canoe . </s>  They pushed off ,  but as they dipped the paddles into the water ,  they snapped as the bows had done ,  and were quite useless . </s>  ' I know where there are some new ones ,  '  cried a young fellow ,  leaping on shore and rushing to a little cave at the back of the beach . </s>  And the mink ' s heart smote him when he heard ,  for he had not known of this secret store . </s>  After a long chase the wolves managed to surround their prey ,  and the mink ,  seeing it was no good resisting any more ,  gave himself up . </s>  Some of the elder wolves brought out some cedar bands ,  which they always carried wound round their bodies ,  but the mink laughed scornfully at the sight of them . </s>  ' Why I could snap those in a moment ,  '  said he ;   ' if you want to make sure that I cannot escape ,  better take a line of kelp and bind me with that . </s>  '   ' You are right ,  '  answered the grandfather ;   ' your wisdom is greater than ours . </s>  '   And he bade his servants gather enough kelp from the rocks to make a line ,  as they had brought none with them .

I will use it as a table to put my food upon . </s>  '   And gathering up her clothes she took the plank with her into her hut . </s>  When her supper time came she stretched the board across two strings which hung from the roof ,  and set upon it the pot containing a stew that smelt very good . </s>  The woman had been working hard all day and was very hungry ,  so she took her biggest spoon and plunged it into the pot . </s>  But what was her astonishment and disgust when both pot and food vanished instantly before her !

' Why ,  I have given you your dinner ,  and what more do you want ?  '  replied the second . </s>  ' You did not ;  at least I never got it ,  '  said the other . ' I certainly thought you took it from me ;  but here is some more . </s>  '   And again the young man stretched out his hand ;  and the two old women fell to quarrelling afresh . </s>  But when it happened for the third time the old women suspected some trick ,  and one of them exclaimed :   ' I am sure there is a man here ;  tell me ,  are you not my grandson ?  '   ' Yes ,  '  answered the young man ,  who wished to please her ,   ' and in return for your good dinner I will see if I cannot restore your sight ;  for I was taught in the art of healing by the best medicine man in the tribe . </s>  '   And with that he left them ,  and wandered about till he found the herb which he wanted . </s>  Then he hastened back to the old women ,  and begging them to boil him some water ,  he threw the herb in . </s>  As soon as the pot began to sing he took off the lid ,  and sprinkled the eyes of the women ,  and sight came back to them once more . </s>  There was no night in that country ,  so ,  instead of going to bed very early ,  as he would have done in his own hut ,  the young man took another walk . </s>  A splashing noise near by drew him down to a valley through which ran a large river ,  and up a waterfall some salmon were leaping .

This time it is the old ass !   I wonder how he will taste ?  '  And drawing Patto out of the well ,  he flung him across his shoulders and carried him home . </s>  Then he tied a cord round him and hung him over the fire to roast ,  while he finished a box that he was making before the door of the hut ,  which he meant to hold Patto ' s flesh when it was cooked . </s>  In a very short time the box was so nearly done that it only wanted a little more chipping out with an axe ;  but this part of the work was easier accomplished indoors ,  and he called to one of his sons who were lounging inside to bring him the tool . </s>  The young man looked everywhere ,  but he could not find the axe ,  for the very good reason that Patto had managed to pick it up and hide it in his clothes . </s>  ' Stupid fellow !  what is the use of you ?  '  grumbled his father angrily ;  and he bade first one and then another of his sons to fetch him the tool ,  but they had no better success than their brother . </s>  ' I must come myself ,  I suppose !  '  said Stalo ,  putting aside the box . </s>  But ,  meanwhile ,  Patto had slipped from the hook and concealed himself behind the door ,  so that ,  as Stalo stepped in ,  his prisoner raised the axe ,  and with one blow the ogre ' s head was rolling on the ground . </s>  His sons were so frightened at the sight that they all ran away .

Lyma !

Have patience ,  and you will see . </s>  Next to his daughter ,  Balancin loved hunting ,  and it was his custom to spend several mornings every week chasing the boars which abounded in the mountains a few miles from the city . </s>  One day ,  rushing downhill as fast as he could go ,  he put his foot into a hole and fell ,  rolling into a rocky pit of brambles . </s>  The king ' s wounds were not very severe ,  but his face and hands were cut and torn ,  while his feet were in a worse plight still ,  for ,  instead of proper hunting boots ,  he only wore sandals ,  to enable him to run more swiftly . </s>  In a few days the king was as well as ever ,  and the signs of the scratches were almost gone ;  but one foot still remained very sore ,  where a thorn had pierced deeply and had festered . </s>  The best doctors in the kingdom treated it with all their skill ;  they bathed ,  and poulticed ,  and bandaged ,  but it was in vain . </s>  The foot only grew worse and worse ,  and became daily more swollen and painful . </s>  After everyone had tried his own particular cure ,  and found it fail ,  there came news of a wonderful doctor in some distant land who had healed the most astonishing diseases . </s>  On inquiring ,  it was found that he never left the walls of his own city ,  and expected his patients to come to see him ;  but ,  by dint of offering a large sum of money ,  the king persuaded the famous physician to undertake the journey to his own court . </s>  On his arrival the doctor was led at once into the king ' s presence ,  and made a careful examination of his foot . </s>  ' Alas !  your majesty ,  '  he said ,  when he had finished ,   ' the wound is beyond the power of man to heal ;  but though I cannot cure it ,  I can at least deaden the pain ,  and enable you to walk without so much suffering . </s>  '   ' Oh ,  if you can only do that ,  '  cried the king ,   ' I shall be grateful to you for life !   Give your own orders ;  they shall be obeyed . </s>  '   ' Then let your majesty bid the royal shoemaker make you a shoe of goat-skin very loose and comfortable ,  while I prepare a varnish to paint over it of which I alone have the secret !  '   So saying ,  the doctor bowed himself out ,  leaving the king more cheerful and hopeful than he had been for long . </s>  The days passed very slowly with him during the making of the shoe and the preparation of the varnish ,  but on the eighth morning the physician appeared ,  bringing with him the shoe in a case . </s>  He drew it out to slip on the king ' s foot ,  and over the goat-skin he had rubbed a polish so white that the snow itself was not more dazzling . </s>  ' While you wear this shoe you will not feel the slightest pain ,  '  said the doctor . </s>  ' For the balsam with which I have rubbed it inside and out has ,  besides its healing balm ,  the quality of strengthening the material it touches ,  so that ,  even were your majesty to live a thousand years ,  you would find the slipper just as fresh at the end of that time as it is now . </s>  '  The king was so eager to put it on that he hardly gave the physician time to finish . </s>  He snatched it from the case and thrust his foot into it ,  nearly weeping for joy when he found he could walk and run as easily as any beggar boy . </s>  ' What can I give you ?  '  he cried ,  holding out both hands to the man who had worked this wonder . </s>  ' Stay with me ,  and I will heap on you riches greater than ever you dreamed of . </s>  '   But the doctor said he would accept nothing more than had been agreed on ,  and must return at once to his own country ,  where many sick people were awaiting him . </s>  So king Balancin had to content himself with ordering the physician to be treated with royal honours ,  and desiring that an escort should attend him on his journey home . </s>  For two years everything went smoothly at court ,  and to king Balancin and his daughter the sun no sooner rose than it seemed time for it to set . </s>  Now ,  the king ' s birthday fell in the month of June ,  and as the weather happened to be unusually fine ,  he told the princess to celebrate it in any way that pleased her . </s>  Diamantina was very fond of being on the river ,  and she was delighted at this chance of delighting her tastes . </s>  She would have a merry-making such as never had been seen before ,  and in the evening ,  when they were tired of sailing and rowing ,  there should be music and dancing ,  plays and fireworks . </s>  At the very end ,  before the people went home ,  every poor person should be given a loaf of bread and every girl who was to be married within the year a new dress . </s>  The great day appeared to Diamantina to be long in coming ,  but ,  like other days ,  it came at last . </s>  Before the sun was fairly up in the heavens the princess ,  too full of excitement to stay in the palace ,  was walking about the streets so covered with precious stones that you had to shade your eyes before you could look at her . </s>  By-and-by a trumpet sounded ,  and she hurried home ,  only to appear again in a few moments walking by the side of her father down to the river . </s>  Here a splendid barge was waiting for them ,  and from it they watched all sorts of races and feats of swimming and diving . </s>  When these were over the barge proceeded up the river to the field where the dancing and concerts were to take place ,  and after the prizes had been given away to the winners ,  and the loaves and the dresses had been distributed by the princess ,  they bade farewell to their guests ,  and turned to step into the barge which was to carry them back to the palace . </s>  Then a dreadful thing happened . </s>  As the king stepped on board the boat one of the sandals of the white slipper ,  which had got loose ,  caught in a nail that was sticking out ,  and caused the king to stumble . </s>  The pain was great ,  and unconsciously he turned and shook his foot ,  so that the sandals gave way ,  and in a moment the precious shoe was in the river .

"  The man rejoiced when he heard these words and said ,   " On my head be it !  I will go back with you ;  "  and ,  returning with them river-wards ,  made a cast and waited a while ;  then he hauled in the rope and dragged the net ashore and there appeared in it a chest padlocked and heavy . </s>  The Caliph examined it and lifted it finding it weighty ;  so he gave the fisherman two hundred dinars and sent him about his business ;  whilst Masrur ,  aided by the Caliph ,  carried the chest to the palace and set it down and lighted the candles . </s>  Ja ' afar and Masrur then broke it open and found therein a basket of palm-leaves corded with red worsted . </s>  This they cut open and saw within it a piece of carpet which they lifted out ,  and under it was a woman ' s mantilla folded in four ,  which they pulled out ;  and at the bottom of the chest they came upon a young lady ,  fair as a silver ingot ,  slain and cut into nineteen pieces . </s>  When the Caliph looked upon her he cried ,   " Alas !

"  And then ,  without pausing to say good-by ,  it ran swiftly away and was lost among the stones . </s>  The woman returned to the house much perplexed by what the beetle had said ,  and when her husband came in from his work she told him the whole story . </s>  The poor man thought deeply for a time ,  and then declared :   " Wife ,  there may be truth in what the bug told you . </s>  There must be magic in the world yet ,  if a beetle can speak ;  and if there is such a thing as magic we may get water from the well . </s>  The pump I bought to use in the well which proved to be dry is now lying in the barn ,  and the only expense in following the talking bug ' s advice will be the labor of digging the hole . </s>  Labor I am used to ;  so I will dig the well . </s>  "  Next day he set about it ,  and dug so far down in the ground that he could hardly reach the top to climb out again ;  but not a drop of water was found . </s>  " Perhaps you did not dig deep enough ,  "  his wife said ,  when he told her of his failure . </s>  So the following day he made a long ladder ,  which he put into the hole ;  and then he dug ,  and dug ,  and dug ,  until the top of the ladder barely reached the top of the hole . </s>  But still there was no water . When the woman next went to the brook with her pail she saw the beetle sitting upon a stone beside her path . </s>  So she stopped and said :   " My husband has dug the well ;  but there is no water . "   " Did he put the pump in the well ?  "  asked the beetle . </s>  " No ,  "  she answered . " Then do as I commanded ;  put in the pump ,  and if you do not get water I promise you something still more precious . </s>  "  Saying which ,  the beetle swiftly slid from the stone and disappeared . The woman went back to the house and told her husband what the bug had said . </s>  " Well ,  "  replied the simple fellow ,   " there can be no harm in trying . </s>  "  So he got the pump from the barn and placed it in the well ,  and then he took hold of the handle and began to pump ,  while his wife stood by to watch what would happen . </s>  No water came ,  but after a few moments a gold piece dropped from the spout of the pump ,  and then another ,  and another ,  until several handfuls of gold lay in a little heap upon the ground . </s>  The man stopped pumping then and ran to help his wife gather the gold pieces into her apron ;  but their hands trembled so greatly through excitement and joy that they could scarcely pick up the sparkling coins . </s>  At last she gathered them close to her bosom and together they ran to the house ,  where they emptied the precious gold upon the table and counted the pieces . </s>  All were stamped with the design of the United States mint and were worth five dollars each . </s>  Some were worn and somewhat discolored from use ,  while others seemed bright and new ,  as if they had not been much handled . </s>  When the value of the pieces was added together they were found to be worth three hundred dollars . Suddenly the woman spoke . </s>  " Husband ,  the beetle said truly when he declared we should get something more precious than water from the well . </s>  But run at once and take away the handle from the pump ,  lest anyone should pass this way and discover our secret . </s>  "  So the man ran to the pump and removed the handle ,  which he carried to the house and hid underneath the bed . </s>  They hardly slept a wink that night ,  lying awake to think of their good fortune and what they should do with their store of yellow gold . </s>  In all their former lives they had never possessed more than a few dollars at a time ,  and now the cracked teapot was nearly full of gold coins . </s>  The following day was Sunday ,  and they arose early and ran to see if their treasure was safe . </s>  There it lay ,  heaped snugly within the teapot ,  and they were so willing to feast their eyes upon it that it was long before the man could leave it to build the fire or the woman to cook the breakfast . </s>  While they ate their simple meal the woman said :   " We will go to church to-day and return thanks for the riches that have come to us so suddenly . </s>  And I will give the pastor one of the gold pieces .

So long a period of fine weather had indeed never been known upon that mountain . </s>  The only uncomfortable thing was that her nurse was so nervous and particular about being in before the sun was down that often she would take to her heels when nothing worse than a fleecy cloud crossing the sun threw a shadow on the hillside ;  and many an evening they were home a full hour before the sunlight had left the weather-cock on the stables . </s>  If it had not been for such odd behaviour Irene would by this time have almost forgotten the goblins . </s>  She never forgot Curdie ,  but him she remembered for his own sake ,  and indeed would have remembered him if only because a princess never forgets her debts until they are paid . </s>  One splendid sunshiny day ,  about an hour after noon ,  Irene ,  who was playing on a lawn in the garden ,  heard the distant blast of a bugle . </s>  She jumped up with a cry of joy ,  for she knew by that particular blast that her father was on his way to see her . </s>  This part of the garden lay on the slope of the hill and allowed a full view of the country below . </s>  So she shaded her eyes with her hand and looked far away to catch the first glimpse of shining armour . In a few moments a little troop came glittering round the shoulder of a hill . </s>  Spears and helmets were sparkling and gleaming ,  banners were flying ,  horses prancing ,  and again came the bugle-blast which was to her like the voice of her father calling across the distance :   ' Irene ,  I am coming . </s>  '  On and on they came until she could clearly distinguish the king . He rode a white horse and was taller than any of the men with him . </s>  He wore a narrow circle of gold set with jewels around his helmet ,  and as he came still nearer Irene could discern the flashing of the stones in the sun . </s>  It was a long time since he had been to see her ,  and her little heart beat faster and faster as the shining troop approached ,  for she loved her king-papa very dearly and was nowhere so happy as in his arms . </s>  When they reached a certain point ,  after which she could see them no more from the garden ,  she ran to the gate ,  and there stood till up they came ,  clanging and stamping ,  with one more bright bugle-blast which said :   ' Irene ,  I am come . </s>  '  By this time the people of the house were all gathered at the gate ,  but Irene stood alone in front of them . </s>  When the horsemen pulled up she ran to the side of the white horse and held up her arms . The king stopped and took her hands . </s>  In an instant she was on the saddle and clasped in his great strong arms . I wish I could describe the king so that you could see him in your mind . </s>  He had gentle ,  blue eyes ,  but a nose that made him look like an eagle . </s>  A long dark beard ,  streaked with silvery lines ,  flowed from his mouth almost to his waist ,  and as Irene sat on the saddle and hid her glad face upon his bosom it mingled with the golden hair which her mother had given her ,  and the two together were like a cloud with streaks of the sun woven through it . </s>  After he had held her to his heart for a minute he spoke to his white horse ,  and the great beautiful creature ,  which had been prancing so proudly a little while before ,  walked as gently as a lady -- for he knew he had a little lady on his back -- through the gate and up to the door of the house . </s>  Then the king set her on the ground and ,  dismounting ,  took her hand and walked with her into the great hall ,  which was hardly ever entered except when he came to see his little princess . </s>  There he sat down ,  with two of his counsellors who had accompanied him ,  to have some refreshment ,  and Irene sat on his right hand and drank her milk out of a wooden bowl curiously carved . </s>  After the king had eaten and drunk he turned to the princess and said ,  stroking her hair :   ' Now ,  my child ,  what shall we do next ?  '  This was the question he almost always put to her first after their meal together ;  and Irene had been waiting for it with some impatience ,  for now ,  she thought ,  she should be able to settle a question which constantly perplexed her . </s>  ' I should like you to take me to see my great old grandmother . </s>  '  The king looked grave And said :   ' What does my little daughter mean ?  '   ' I mean the Queen Irene that lives up in the tower -- the very old lady ,  you know ,  with the long hair of silver . </s>  '  The king only gazed at his little princess with a look which she could not understand . </s>  ' She ' s got her crown in her bedroom ,  '  she went on ;   ' but I have not been in there yet . </s>  You know she ' s there ,  do not you ?  '   ' No ,  '  said the king ,  very quietly . ' Then it must all be a dream ,  '  said Irene . </s>  ' I half thought it was ;  but I could not be sure . Now I am sure of it . Besides ,  I could not find her the next time I went up . </s>  '  At that moment a snow-white pigeon flew in at an open window and settled upon Irene ' s head . </s>  She broke into a merry laugh ,  cowered a little ,  and put up her hands to her head ,  saying :   ' Dear dovey ,  do not peck me . </s>  You will pull out my hair with your long claws if you do not mind . </s>  '  The king stretched out his hand to take the pigeon ,  but it spread its wings and flew again through the open window ,  when its Whiteness made one flash in the sun and vanished . </s>  The king laid his hand on his princess ' s head ,  held it back a little ,  gazed in her face ,  smiled half a smile ,  and sighed half a sigh . </s>  ' Come ,  my child ;  we will have a walk in the garden together ,  '  he said . </s>  ' You wo not come up and see my huge ,  great ,  beautiful grandmother ,  then ,  king-papa ?  '  said the princess . ' Not this time ,  '  said the king very gently . </s>  ' She has not invited me ,  you know ,  and great old ladies like her do not choose to be visited without leave asked and given . '  The garden was a very lovely place . </s>  Being upon a Mountainside there were parts in it where the rocks came through in great masses ,  and all immediately about them remained quite wild . </s>  Tufts of heather grew upon them ,  and other hardy mountain plants and flowers ,  while near them would be lovely roses and lilies and all pleasant garden flowers . </s>  This mingling of the wild mountain with the civilized garden was very quaint ,  and it was impossible for any number of gardeners to make such a garden look formal and stiff . </s>  Against one of these rocks was a garden seat ,  shadowed from the afternoon sun by the overhanging of the rock itself . </s>  There was a little winding path up to the top of the rock ,  and on top another seat ;  but they sat on the seat at its foot because the sun was hot ;  and there they talked together of many things . </s>  At length the king said :   ' You were out late one evening ,  Irene . '   ' Yes ,  papa . It was my fault ;  and Lootie was very sorry . </s>  '   ' I must talk to Lootie about it ,  '  said the king . ' Do not speak loud to her ,  please ,  papa ,  '  said Irene . </s>  ' She ' s been so afraid of being late ever since !   Indeed she has not been naughty . It was only a mistake for once . </s>  '   ' Once might be too often ,  '  murmured the king to himself ,  as he stroked his child ' s head . I ca not tell you how he had come to know . </s>  I am sure Curdie had not told him . Someone about the palace must have seen them ,  after all . He sat for a good while thinking . </s>

There was a hideous noise in her room -- creatures snarling and hissing and rocketing about as if they were fighting . </s>  The moment she came to herself ,  she remembered something she had never thought of again -- what her grandmother told her to do when she was frightened . </s>  She immediately took off her ring and put it under her pillow . As she did so she fancied she felt a finger and thumb take it gently from under her palm . </s>  ' It must be my grandmother !  '  she said to herself ,  and the thought gave her such courage that she stopped to put on her dainty little slippers before running from the room . </s>  While doing this she caught sight of a long cloak of sky-blue ,  thrown over the back of a chair by the bedside . She had never seen it before but it was evidently waiting for her . </s>  She put it on ,  and then ,  feeling with the forefinger of her right hand ,  soon found her grandmother ' s thread ,  which she proceeded at once to follow ,  expecting it would lead her straight up the old stair . </s>  When she reached the door she found it went down and ran along the floor ,  so that she had almost to crawl in order to keep a hold of it . </s>  Then ,  to her surprise ,  and somewhat to her dismay ,  she found that instead of leading her towards the stair it turned in quite the opposite direction . </s>  It led her through certain narrow passages towards the kitchen ,  turning aside ere she reached it ,  and guiding her to a door which communicated with a small back yard . </s>  Some of the maids were already up ,  and this door was standing open . </s>  Across the yard the thread still ran along the ground ,  until it brought her to a door in the wall which opened upon the Mountainside . </s>  When she had passed through ,  the thread rose to about half her height ,  and she could hold it with ease as she walked . It led her straight up the mountain . </s>  The cause of her alarm was less frightful than she supposed . </s>  The cook ' s great black cat ,  pursued by the housekeeper ' s terrier ,  had bounced against her bedroom door ,  which had not been properly fastened ,  and the two had burst into the room together and commenced a battle royal . </s>  How the nurse came to sleep through it was a mystery ,  but I suspect the old lady had something to do with it . It was a clear warm morning . </s>  The wind blew deliciously over the Mountainside . Here and there she saw a late primrose but she did not stop to call upon them . The sky was mottled with small clouds . </s>  The sun was not yet up ,  but some of their fluffy edges had caught his light ,  and hung out orange and gold-coloured fringes upon the air . </s>  The dew lay in round drops upon the leaves ,  and hung like tiny diamond ear-rings from the blades of grass about her path . </s>  ' How lovely that bit of gossamer is !  '  thought the princess ,  looking at a long undulating line that shone at some distance from her up the hill . </s>  It was not the time for gossamers though ;  and Irene soon discovered that it was her own thread she saw shining on before her in the light of the morning . </s>  It was leading her she knew not whither ;  but she had never in her life been out before sunrise ,  and everything was so fresh and cool and lively and full of something coming ,  that she felt too happy to be afraid of anything . </s>  After leading her up a good distance ,  the thread turned to the left ,  and down the path upon which she and Lootie had met Curdie . </s>  But she never thought of that ,  for now in the morning light ,  with its far outlook over the country ,  no path could have been more open and airy and cheerful . </s>  She could see the road almost to the horizon ,  along which she had so often watched her king-papa and his troop come shining ,  with the bugle-blast cleaving the air before them ;  and it was like a companion to her . </s>  Down and down the path went ,  then up ,  and then down and then up again ,  getting rugged and more rugged as it went ;  and still along the path went the silvery thread ,  and still along the thread went Irene ' s little rosy-tipped forefinger . </s>  By and by she came to a little stream that jabbered and prattled down the hill ,  and up the side of the stream went both path and thread . </s>  And still the path grew rougher and steeper ,  and the mountain grew wilder ,  till Irene began to think she was going a very long way from home ;  and when she turned to look back she saw that the level country had vanished and the rough bare mountain had closed in about her . </s>  But still on went the thread ,  and on went the princess . </s>  Everything around her was getting brighter and brighter as the sun came nearer ;  till at length his first rays all at once alighted on the top of a rock before her ,  like some golden creature fresh from the sky . </s>  Then she saw that the little stream ran out of a hole in that rock ,  that the path did not go past the rock ,  and that the thread was leading her straight up to it . </s>  A shudder ran through her from head to foot when she found that the thread was actually taking her into the hole out of which the stream ran . </s>  It ran out babbling joyously ,  but she had to go in . She did not hesitate . Right into the hole she went ,  which was high enough to let her walk without stooping . </s>  For a little way there was a brown glimmer ,  but at the first turn it all but ceased ,  and before she had gone many paces she was in total darkness . </s>  Then she began to be frightened indeed . </s>  Every moment she kept feeling the thread backwards and forwards ,  and as she went farther and farther into the darkness of the great hollow mountain ,  she kept thinking more and more about her grandmother ,  and all that she had said to her ,  and how kind she had been ,  and how beautiful she was ,  and all about her lovely room ,  and the fire of roses ,  and the great lamp that sent its light through stone walls . </s>  And she became more and more sure that the thread could not have gone there of itself ,  and that her grandmother must have sent it . </s>  But it tried her dreadfully when the path went down very steep ,  and especially When she came to places where she had to go down rough stairs ,  and even sometimes a ladder . </s>  Through one narrow passage after another ,  over lumps of rock and sand and clay ,  the thread guided her ,  until she came to a small hole through which she had to creep . </s>  Finding no change on the other side ,   ' Shall I ever get back ?  '  she thought ,  over and over again ,  wondering at herself that she was not ten times more frightened ,  and often feeling as if she were only walking in the story of a dream . </s>  Sometimes she heard the noise of water ,  a dull gurgling inside the rock . </s>  By and by she heard the sounds of blows ,  which came nearer and nearer ;  but again they grew duller ,  and almost died away . </s>  In a hundred directions she turned ,  obedient to the guiding thread . </s>  At last she spied a dull red shine ,  and came up to the mica window ,  and thence away and round about ,  and right ,  into a cavern ,  where glowed the red embers of a fire . </s>  Here the thread began to rise . It rose as high as her head and higher still . </s>  What should she do if she lost her hold ?  She was pulling it down :  She might break it !  She could see it far up ,  glowing as red as her fire-opal in the light of the embers . </s>  But presently she came to a huge heap of stones ,  piled in a slope against the wall of the cavern . </s>  On these she climbed ,  and soon recovered the level of the thread only however to find ,  the next moment ,  that it vanished through the heap of stones ,  and left her standing on it ,  with her face to the solid rock .

You will have the worst of the pother . </s>  Smash ,  bother ,  jabber !  --  '  Here Curdie stopped ,  either because he could not find a rhyme to  ' jabber '  ,  or because he remembered what he had forgotten when he woke up at the sound of Irene ' s labours ,  that his plan was to make the goblins think he was getting weak . </s>  But he had uttered enough to let Irene know who he was . ' It ' s Curdie !  '  she cried joyfully . ' Hush !  hush !  '  came Curdie ' s voice again from somewhere . ' Speak softly . </s>  '   ' Why ,  you were singing loud !  '  said Irene . ' Yes . But they know I am here ,  and they do not know you are . </s>  Who are you ?  '   ' I am Irene ,  '  answered the princess . ' I know who you are quite well . You are Curdie . </s>  '   ' Why ,  how ever did you come here ,  Irene ?  '   ' My great-great-grandmother sent me ;  and I think I have found out why . </s>  You ca not get out ,  I suppose ?  '   ' No ,  I ca not . What are you doing ?  '   ' Clearing away a huge heap of stones . </s>  '   ' There ' s a princess !  '  exclaimed Curdie ,  in a tone of delight ,  but still speaking in little more than a whisper . ' I ca not think how you got here ,  though . </s>  '   ' My grandmother sent me after her thread . '   ' I do not know what you mean ,  '  said Curdie ;   ' but so you are there ,  it does not much matter . </s>  '   ' Oh ,  yes ,  it does !  '  returned Irene . ' I should never have been here but for her . '   ' You can tell me all about it when we get out ,  then . </s>  There ' s no time to lose now ,  ' said Curdie . And Irene went to work ,  as fresh as when she began . ' There ' s such a lot of stones !  '  she said . </s>  ' It will take me a long time to get them all away . '   ' How far on have you got ?  '  asked Curdie . </s>  ' I have got about the half away ,  but the other half is ever so much bigger . '   ' I do not think you will have to move the lower half . </s>  Do you see a slab laid up against the wall ?  '  Irene looked ,  and felt about with her hands ,  and soon perceived the outlines of the slab . </s>  ' Yes ,  '  she answered ,   ' I do . </s>  '   ' Then ,  I think ,  '  rejoined Curdie ,   ' when you have cleared the slab about half-way down ,  or a bit more ,  I shall be able to push it over . </s>  '   ' I must follow my thread ,  '  returned Irene ,   ' whatever I do . '   ' What do you mean ?  '  exclaimed Curdie . </s>  ' You will see when you get out ,  '  answered the princess ,  and went on harder than ever . </s>  But she was soon satisfied that what Curdie wanted done and what the thread wanted done were one and the same thing . </s>  For she not only saw that by following the turns of the thread she had been clearing the face of the slab ,  but that ,  a little more than half-way down ,  the thread went through the chink between the slab and the wall into the place where Curdie was confined ,  so that she could not follow it any farther until the slab was out of her way . </s>  As soon as she found this ,  she said in a right joyous whisper :   ' Now ,  Curdie ,  I think if you were to give a great push ,  the slab would tumble over . </s>  '   ' Stand quite clear of it ,  then ,  '  said Curdie ,   ' and let me know when you are ready . '  Irene got off the heap ,  and stood on one side of it . </s>  ' Now ,  Curdie !  '  she cried . Curdie gave a great rush with his shoulder against it . Out tumbled the slab on the heap ,  and out crept Curdie over the top of it . </s>  ' You have saved my life ,  Irene !  '  he whispered . ' Oh ,  Curdie !  I am so glad !   Let ' s get out of this horrid place as fast as we can . </s>  '   ' That ' s easier said than done ,  '  returned he . ' Oh ,  no ,  it ' s quite easy ,  '  said Irene . ' We have only to follow my thread . </s>  I am sure that it ' s going to take us out now . </s>  '  She had already begun to follow it over the fallen slab into the hole ,  while Curdie was searching the floor of the cavern for his pickaxe . ' Here it is !  '  he cried . </s>  ' No ,  it is not ,  '  he added ,  in a disappointed tone . ' What can it be ,  then ?   I declare it ' s a torch . </s>  That is jolly !  It ' s better almost than my pickaxe . </s>  Much better if it were not for those stone shoes !  '  he went on ,  as he lighted the torch by blowing the last embers of the expiring fire . </s>  When he looked up ,  with the lighted torch casting a glare into the great darkness of the huge cavern ,  he caught sight of Irene disappearing in the hole out of which he had himself just come . </s>  ' Where are you going there ?  '  he cried . ' That ' s not the way out . That ' s where I could not get out . '   ' I know that ,  '  whispered Irene . </s>  ' But this is the way my thread goes ,  and I must follow it . '   ' What nonsense the child talks !  '  said Curdie to himself . </s>  ' I must follow her ,  though ,  and see that she comes to no harm .

"   " Why ,  "  said Fin ,   " ever since I was the height of a round tower ,  I was known to be fond of having a good prospect of my own ;  and where the dickens ,  neighbours ,  could I find a better spot for a good prospect than the top of Knockmany ?  As for water ,  I am sinking a pump ,  and ,  plase goodness ,  as soon as the Causeway ' s made ,  I intend to finish it . </s>  "  Now ,  this was more of Fin ' s philosophy ;  for the real state of the case was ,  that he pitched upon the top of Knockmany in order that he might be able to see Cucullin coming towards the house . </s>  All we have to say is ,  that if he wanted a spot from which to keep a sharp look-out -- and ,  between ourselves ,  he did want it grievously -- barring Slieve Croob ,  or Slieve Donard ,  or its own cousin ,  Cullamore ,  he could not find a neater or more convenient situation for it in the sweet and sagacious province of Ulster . </s>  " God save all here !
