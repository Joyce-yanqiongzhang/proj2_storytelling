"  Then King Agamemnon came forth from his tent ,  saying ,   " What  meaneth this uproar and disputing that I hear ?  "  And Menelaüs answered ,   " Seest thou this letter that I hold  in my hand ?  "   " I see it :  it is mine . </s>  Give it to me . "   " I give it not till I have read that which is written therein  to all the army of the Greeks . </s>  "   " Where didst thou find it ?  "   " I found it while I waited for thy daughter till she should  come to the camp . </s>  "   " What hast thou to do with that ?  May I not rule my own  household ?

And now thou art gone back from  thy word . </s>  Surely this is an evil day for Greece ,  that is troubled  because thou wantest wisdom . </s>  "  Then answered King Agamemnon :   " What is thy quarrel with me ?   Why blamest thou me if thou couldst not rule thy wife ?  And now to win  back this woman ,  because forsooth she is fair ,  thou castest aside  both reason and honor . </s>  And I ,  if I had an ill purpose and now have  changed it for that which is wiser ,  dost thou charge me with folly ?   Let them that sware the oath to Tyndareus go with thee on this  errand . </s>  Why should I slay my child and work for myself sorrow and  remorse without end that thou mayest have vengeance for thy wicked  wife ?  "  Then Menelaüs turned away in a rage ,  crying ,   " Betray me if  thou wilt . </s>  I will betake myself to other counsels and other friends . </s>  "  But even as he spake there came a messenger ,  saying ,   " King  Agamemnon ,  I am come ,  as thou badest me ,  with thy daughter Iphigenia . </s>  Also her mother ,  Queen Clytæmnestra ,  is come ,  bringing with her her  little son Orestes . </s>  And now they are resting themselves and their  horses by the side of a spring ,  for indeed the way is long and weary . </s>  And all the army is gathered about them to see them and greet them .

For that she is rightly come to the marriage of her  daughter ,  who can deny ?  But what will she say when she knoweth my  purpose ?  And of the maiden ,  what shall I say ?  Unhappy maiden whose  bridegroom shall be death !  For she will cry to me ,   ' Wilt thou kill  me ,  my father ?  '  And the little Orestes will wail ,  not knowing what he  doeth ,  seeing he is but a babe . </s>  Cursed be Paris ,  who hath wrought  this woe !  "  And now King Menelaüs came back ,  saying that it repented him of  what he had said ,   " For why should thy child die for me ?  What  hath she to do with Helen ?  Let the army be scattered ,  so that this  wrong be not done . </s>  "  Then said King Agamemnon ,   " But how shall I escape from this  strait ?  For the whole host will compel me to this deed ?  "   " Not so ,  "  said King Menelaüs ,   " if thou wilt send  back the maiden to Argos . </s>  "   " But what shall that profit ,  "  said the king ;   " for  Calchas will cause the matter to be known ,  or Ulysses ,  saying that I  have failed of my promise ;  and if I fly to Argos ,  they will come and  destroy my city and lay waste my land . </s>  Woe is me !  in what a strait am  I set !  But take thou care ,  my brother ,  that Clytæmnestra hear  nothing of these things . </s>  "  And when he had ended speaking ,  the queen herself came unto the  tent ,  riding in a chariot ,  having her daughter by her side . </s>  And she  bade one of the attendants take out with care the caskets which she  had brought for her daughter ,  and bade others help her daughter to  alight and herself also ,  and to a fourth she said that he should take  the young Orestes .

" Perseus ,  "  said King Polydectes ,  smiling craftily upon  him ,   " you are grown up a fine young man . </s>  You and your good  mother have received a great deal of kindness from myself ,  as well as  from my worthy brother the fisherman ,  and I suppose you would not be  sorry to repay some of it . </s>  "   " Please ,  your Majesty ,  "  answered Perseus ,   " I would  willingly risk my life to do so . </s>  "   " Well ,  then ,  "  continued the king ,  still with a cunning  smile on his lips ,   " I have a little adventure to propose to you ,   and as you are a brave and enterprising youth ,  you will doubtless  look upon it as a great piece of good luck to have so rare an  opportunity of distinguishing yourself . </s>  You must know ,  my good  Perseus ,  I think of getting married to the beautiful Princess  Hippodamia ,  and it is customary on these occasions to make the bride  a present of some far-fetched and elegant curiosity . </s>  I have been a  little perplexed ,  I must honestly confess ,  where to obtain anything  likely to please a princess of her exquisite taste . </s>  But this morning ,   I flatter myself ,  I have thought of precisely the article . "   " And can I assist your Majesty in obtaining it ?  "  cried  Perseus ,  eagerly . </s>  " You can if you are as brave a youth as I believe you to be ,  "   replied King Polydectes with the utmost graciousness of manner . </s>  " The  bridal gift which I have set my heart on presenting to the beautiful  Hippodamia is the head of the Gorgon Medusa with the snaky locks ;  and  I depend on you ,  my dear Perseus ,  to bring it to me . </s>  So ,  as I am  anxious to settle affairs with the princess ,  the sooner you go in  quest of the Gorgon ,  the better I shall be pleased . </s>  "   " I will set out tomorrow morning ,  "  answered Perseus . " Pray do so ,  my gallant youth ,  "  rejoined the king . </s>  " And ,   Perseus ,  in cutting off the Gorgon ' s head ,  be careful to make a clean  stroke ,  so as not to injure its appearance . </s>  You must bring it home in  the very best condition in order to suit the exquisite taste of the  beautiful Princess Hippodamia . </s>  "  Perseus left the palace ,  but was scarcely out of hearing before  Polydectes burst into a laugh ,  being greatly amused ,  wicked king that  he was ,  to find how readily the young man fell into the snare . </s>  The  news quickly spread abroad that Perseus had undertaken to cut off the  head of Medusa with the snaky locks . </s>  Everybody was rejoiced ,  for most  of the inhabitants of the island were as wicked as the king himself  and would have liked nothing better than to see some enormous  mischief happen to Danaë and her son . </s>  The only good man in this  unfortunate island of Seriphus appears to have been the fisherman . </s>  As  Perseus walked along ,  therefore ,  the people pointed after him and  made mouths ,  and winked to one another and ridiculed him as loudly as  they dared . </s>  " Ho ,  ho !  "  cried they ;   " Medusa ' s snakes will sting  him soundly !  "  Now ,  there were three Gorgons alive at that period ,  and they were  the most strange and terrible monsters that had ever been since the  world was made ,  or that have been seen in after days ,  or that are  likely to be seen in all time to come . </s>  I hardly know what sort of  creature or hobgoblin to call them . </s>  They were three sisters and seem  to have borne some distant resemblance to women ,  but were really a  very frightful and mischievous species of dragon . </s>  It is ,  indeed ,   difficult to imagine what hideous beings these three sisters were . </s>  Why ,  instead of locks of hair ,  if you can believe men ,  they had each  of them a hundred enormous snakes growing on their heads ,  all alive ,   twisting ,  wriggling ,  curling and thrusting out their venomous  tongues ,  with forked stings at the end !  The teeth of the Gorgons were  terribly long tusks ,  their hands were made of brass ,  and their bodies  were all over scales ,  which ,  if not iron ,  were something as hard and  impenetrable . </s>  They had wings ,  too ,  and exceedingly splendid ones ,  I  can assure you ,  for every feather in them was pure ,  bright ,   glittering ,  burnished gold ;  and they looked very dazzling ,  no doubt ,   when the Gorgons were flying about in the sunshine . </s>  But when people happened to catch a glimpse of their glittering  brightness ,  aloft in the air ,  they seldom stopped to gaze ,  but ran  and hid themselves as speedily as they could . </s>  You will think ,   perhaps ,  that they were afraid of being stung by the serpents that  served the Gorgons instead of hair—or of having their heads bitten  off by their ugly tusks—or of being torn all to pieces by their  brazen claws . </s>  Well ,  to be sure ,  these were some of the dangers ,  but  by no means the greatest nor the most difficult to avoid . </s>  For the  worst thing about these abominable Gorgons was that if once a poor  mortal fixed his eyes full upon one of their faces ,  he was certain  that very instant to be changed from warm flesh and blood into cold  and lifeless stone !  Thus ,  as you will easily perceive ,  it was a very dangerous  adventure that the wicked King Polydectes had contrived for this  innocent young man . </s>  Perseus himself ,  when he had thought over the  matter ,  could not help seeing that he had very little chance of  coming safely through it ,  and that he was far more likely to become a  stone image than to bring back the head of Medusa with the snaky  locks . </s>  For ,  not to speak of other difficulties ,  there was one which  it would have puzzled an older man than Perseus to get over . </s>  Not only  must he fight with and slay this golden-winged ,  iron-scaled ,   long-tusked ,  brazen-clawed ,  snaky-haired monster ,  but he must do it  with his eyes shut ,  or ,  at least ,  without so much as a glance at the  enemy with whom he was contending . </s>  Else ,  while his arm was lifted to  strike ,  he would stiffen into stone and stand with that uplifted arm  for centuries ,  until time and the wind and weather should crumble him  quite away . </s>  This would be a very sad thing to befall a young man who  wanted to perform a great many brave deeds and to enjoy a great deal  of happiness in this bright and beautiful world .

" She is not winded ,  "  he said . </s>  " What is she lying down for ?  "  But Bran and Sceo ' lan did not stop ;  they added another inch to their long-stretched easy bodies ,  and came up on the fawn . </s>  " It is an easy kill ,  "  said Fionn regretfully . " They have her ,  "  he cried .

Fionn came up then . </s>  His long spear was lowered in his fist at the thrust ,  and his sharp knife was in its sheath ,  but he did not use them ,  for the fawn and the two hounds began to play round him ,  and the fawn was as affectionate towards him as the hounds were ;  so that when a velvet nose was thrust in his palm ,  it was as often a fawn ' s muzzle as a hound ' s . </s>  In that joyous company he came to wide Allen of Leinster ,  where the people were surprised to see the hounds and the fawn and the Chief and none other of the hunters that had set out with them . </s>  When the others reached home ,  the Chief told of his chase ,  and it was agreed that such a fawn must not be killed ,  but that it should be kept and well treated ,  and that it should be the pet fawn of the Fianna . </s>  But some of those who remembered Brah ' s parentage thought that as Bran herself had come from the Shi so this fawn might have come out of the Shi also . </s>  Late that night ,  when he was preparing for rest ,  the door of Fionn ' s chamber opened gently and a young woman came into the room . </s>  The captain stared at her ,  as he well might ,  for he had never seen or imagined to see a woman so beautiful as this was . </s>  Indeed ,  she was not a woman ,  but a young girl ,  and her bearing was so gently noble ,  her look so modestly high ,  that the champion dared scarcely look at her ,  although he could not by any means have looked away . </s>  As she stood within the doorway ,  smiling ,  and shy as a flower ,  beautifully timid as a fawn ,  the Chief communed with his heart . </s>  " She is the Sky-woman of the Dawn ,  "  he said . " She is the light on the foam . She is white and odorous as an apple-blossom . She smells of spice and honey . </s>  She is my beloved beyond the women of the world .

" I do not seem to know you ,  "  he said . " You do not know me indeed ,  "  she replied . </s>  " It is the more wonderful ,  "  he continued gently ,   " for I should know every person that is here . What do you require from me ?  "   " I beg your protection ,  royal captain . </s>  "   " I give that to all ,  "  he answered . " Against whom do you desire protection ?  "   " I am in terror of the Fear Doirche . </s>  "   " The Dark Man of the Shi ?  "   " He is my enemy ,  "  she said . " He is mine now ,  "  said Fionn . " Tell me your story . </s>  "   " My name is Saeve ,  and I am a woman of Faery ,  "  she commenced . </s>  " In the Shi '  many men gave me their love ,  but I gave my love to no man of my country . "   " That was not reasonable ,  "  the other chided with a blithe heart . </s>  " I was contented ,  "  she replied ,   " and what we do not want we do not lack . </s>  But if my love went anywhere it went to a mortal ,  a man of the men of Ireland . </s>  "   " By my hand ,  "  said Fionn in mortal distress ,   " I marvel who that man can be !  "   " He is known to you ,  "  she murmured . </s>  " I lived thus in the peace of Faery ,  hearing often of my mortal champion ,  for the rumour of his great deeds had gone through the Shi '  ,  until a day came when the Black Magician of the Men of God put his eye on me ,  and ,  after that day ,  in whatever direction I looked I saw his eye .

Besides ,  there was so much treasure packed away already ,  that it was difficult to find a safe place for any more . </s>  His anxiety made the king so unhappy ,  and caused him so many sleepless nights ,  that he determined at last to build a large chamber of stone ,  with walls too thick for any thief to break through . </s>  He sent for his chief architect ,  who collected a great multitude of workmen and set to work building the chamber without delay . </s>  Whole villages were compelled to join in the work ;  even the old men and children were employed in carrying away rubbish ,  bringing water and clay ,  and doing other work that was not too hard for them . </s>  The stronger and more skillful workmen hewed great blocks of granite ,  which were dragged to the place on wooden sledges ;  and ,  as they had no cranes to lift the stones into their places on the walls ,  they were obliged to build mounds of sand and rough bricks ,  and roll up each stone gradually with wooden levers ,  until they got it into its proper place . </s>  It was terribly hard work ,  but there were so many workmen ,  and the foremen used their whips so unmercifully ,  that the walls rose very rapidly . </s>  Now the architect was a cunning man ,  and guessed what the chamber was intended to hold . </s>  He therefore fitted one stone in such a way that it would slide down and leave a hole just large enough for a man to crawl through ;  and yet ,  when you looked at the wall ,  there was no sign at all by which the secret could be discovered . </s>  Nor did the architect think it necessary to mention the secret opening to his majesty ,  when he showed the chamber to him and told him that it was as strong as he could make it . </s>  Rhampsinitus lost no time in moving his treasures into the new treasure-chamber . </s>  The key he kept with him night and day ,  so that at last he could sleep peacefully ,  knowing that any one who wished to pass the solid ,  brass-bound door ,  must first prevail upon him to unlock it . </s>  For some time all went well . The king went to the treasury every morning ,  and found everything in its place . Evidently he had been too clever for the thieves . </s>  In the mean time the architect was lying ill in bed ,  and day by day he grew weaker and weaker ;  until at length he knew that his end was approaching ,  and ,  calling his two sons to his bedside ,  he told them of the secret way into the treasure-chamber . </s>  " I have little of my own to leave you ,  my sons ,  "  he said ,   " and I have but little influence at court ;  but by the aid of this secret ,  which I devised for your sake ,  you may become rich men ,  and hold the office of king’s treasurers for life . </s>  "  The young men were delighted at his words ,  and so impatient were they to enjoy their good fortune ,  that on the very night of their father’s funeral they stole away quietly to the place where the treasure-house stood . </s>  They found the sliding stone exactly as their father had described it . </s>  The younger and slimmer of the two brothers crawled through the opening and found himself in a dark chamber ,  surrounded by heavy chests and jars with sealed covers . </s>  Breaking open one of the latter ,  he put in his hand and drew out a handful of gold ,  which sparkled and twinkled at him even in the faint light which came through the hole in the wall . </s>  Handful after handful he drew out and passed to his brother ,  at the same time filling the bags he had brought with him ,  until both had as much as they could conveniently carry . </s>  Then they replaced the stone ,  and returned to lay the treasure before their mother ;  for in those days stealing was considered rather a clever trick ,  and even the thief’s mother did not scold him ,  so long as he was not so clumsy as to be caught . </s>  Imagine the consternation of King Rhampsinitus when he visited the chamber the following morning !  Everything seemed as secure as ever ,  and yet ,  when he opened the door ,  there lay one of the great jars turned over and empty ,  while the lid of one of the chests was broken open and part of the contents scattered on the floor . </s>  He examined every nook and cranny of the chamber from floor to ceiling ,  and there was no sign of any one’s having forced an entrance . </s>  The fastenings of the door were firm ,  and the lock was one which it was perfectly impossible to pick . </s>  For greater security ,  however ,  Rhampsinitus sent at once for a locksmith ,  and commanded him to fit the door with a second lock ,  the key of which he kept with the other . </s>  Notwithstanding this precaution ,  the treasure-chamber was robbed again on the next night ,  and this time the thieves had broken open a great many of the chests ,  and carried away some of the most valuable jewels . </s>  On the following night a sentinel was posted ,  and still the treasury was robbed . </s>  The sentinel vowed that he had stood with his back to the door all night ,  and there is little doubt that he spoke the truth ,  though the poor fellow was accused of sleeping at his post ,  and punished for his negligence . </s>  Then the king took counsel of the fan-bearer on the right hand ,  who was also prime minister . </s>  He made a long speech ,  beginning with his regret that his majesty had not thought fit to consult him earlier ,  and concluding with a learned discourse on the habits of rats . </s>  " This is all very interesting ,  "  said Rhampsinitus ,   " but I do not see that it helps very much to protect my treasure . </s>  "   " I crave your majesty’s pardon ,  "  the prime minister answered . </s>  " I was about to observe that the best way to catch a rat is first to study the habits and tastes of the rat ,  and next to apply the knowledge so gained in setting a trap .

They believed they would be sorry . </s>  For ,  said they ,  the buds are the children of the flowers ,  and the little playful streams that gambol down the hill-sides are the children of the water ;  and the smallest bright specks playing at hide and seek in the sky all night ,  must surely be the children of the stars ;  and they would all be grieved to see their playmates ,  the children of men ,  no more . </s>  There was one clear shining star that used to come out in the sky before the rest ,  near the church spire ,  above the graves . </s>  It was larger and more beautiful ,  they thought ,  than all the others ,  and every night they watched for it ,  standing hand in hand at a window . </s>  Whoever saw it first cried out ,   " I see the star !  "  And often they cried out both together ,  knowing so well when it would rise ,  and where . </s>  So they grew to be such friends with it ,  that ,  before lying down in their beds ,  they always looked out once again ,  to bid it good-night ;  and when they were turning round to sleep ,  they used to say ,   " God bless the star !  "  But while she was still very young ,  oh very ,  very young ,  the sister drooped ,  and came to be so weak that she could no longer stand in the window at night ;  and then the child looked sadly out by himself ,  and when he saw the star ,  turned round and said to the patient pale face on the bed ,   " I see the star !  "  and then a smile would come upon the face ,  and a little weak voice used to say ,   " God bless my brother and the star !  "  And so the time came all too soon !  when the child looked out alone ,  and when there was no face on the bed ;  and when there was a little grave among the graves ,  not there before ;  and when the star made long rays down toward him ,  as he saw it through his tears . </s>  Now ,  these rays were so bright ,  and they seemed to make such a shining way from earth to Heaven ,  that when the child went to his solitary bed ,  he dreamed about the star ;  and dreamed that ,  lying where he was ,  he saw a train of people taken up that sparkling road by angels . </s>  And the star ,  opening ,  showed him a great world of light ,  where many more such angels waited to receive them . </s>  All these angels ,  who were waiting ,  turned their beaming eyes upon the people who were carried up into the star ;  and some came out from the long rows in which they stood ,  and fell upon the people ' s necks ,  and kissed them tenderly ,  and went away with them down avenues of light ,  and were so happy in their company ,  that lying in his bed he wept for joy . </s>  But ,  there were many angels who did not go with them ,  and among them one he knew . </s>  The patient face that once had lain upon the bed was glorified and radiant ,  but his heart found out his sister among all the host . </s>  His sister ' s angel lingered near the entrance of the star ,  and said to the leader among those who had brought the people thither :   " Is my brother come ?  "  And he said  " No . </s>  "  She was turning hopefully away ,  when the child stretched out his arms ,  and cried ,   " O ,  sister ,  I am here !  Take me !  "  and then she turned her beaming eyes upon him ,  and it was night ;  and the star was shining into the room ,  making long rays down towards him as he saw it through his tears . </s>  From that hour forth ,  the child looked out upon the star as on the home he was to go to ,  when his time should come ;  and he thought that he did not belong to the earth alone ,  but to the star too ,  because of his sister ' s angel gone before . </s>  There was a baby born to be a brother to the child ;  and while he was so little that he never yet had spoken word he stretched his tiny form out on his bed ,  and died . </s>  Again the child dreamed of the open star ,  and of the company of angels ,  and the train of people ,  and the rows of angels with their beaming eyes all turned upon those people ' s faces . </s>  Said his sister ' s angel to the leader :   " Is my brother come ?  "  And he said  " Not that one ,  but another . </s>  "  As the child beheld his brother ' s angel in her arms ,  he cried ,   " O ,  sister ,  I am here !  Take me !  "  And she turned and smiled upon him ,  and the star was shining . </s>  He grew to be a young man ,  and was busy at his books when an old servant came to him and said :   " Thy mother is no more . </s>  I bring her blessing on her darling son !  "  Again at night he saw the star ,  and all that former company . </s>  Said his sister ' s angel to the leader :   " Is my brother come ?  "  And he said ,   " Thy mother !  "  A mighty cry of joy went forth through all the star ,  because the mother was reunited to her two children . </s>  And he stretched out his arms and cried ,   " O ,  mother ,  sister ,  and brother ,  I am here !  Take me !  "  And they answered him ,   " Not yet ,  "  and the star was shining . </s>  He grew to be a man ,  whose hair was turning gray ,  and he was sitting in his chair by the fireside ,  heavy with grief ,  and with his face bedewed with tears ,  when the star opened once again . </s>  Said his sister ' s angel to the leader :   " Is my brother come ?  "  And he said ,   " Nay ,  but his maiden daughter . </s>  "  And the man who had been the child saw his daughter ,  newly lost to him ,  a celestial creature among those three ,  and he said ,   " My daughter ' s head is on my sister ' s bosom ,  and her arm is around my mother ' s neck ,  and at her feet there is the baby of old time ,  and I can bear the parting from her ,  God be praised !  "  And the star was shining . </s>  Thus the child came to be an old man ,  and his once smooth face was wrinkled ,  and his steps were slow and feeble ,  and his back was bent . </s>  And one night as he lay upon his bed ,  his children standing round ,  he cried ,  as he had cried so long ago :   " I see the star !  "  They whispered one to another ,   " He is dying . </s>  "  And he said ,   " I am . My age is falling from me like a garment ,  and I move towards the star as a child . </s>  And O ,  my Father ,  now I thank Thee that it has so often opened ,  to receive those dear ones who await me !

Go out boldly ,  and save your people from the power of the Midianites . </s>  "  Gideon answered the angel :   " O ,  Lord ,  how can I save Israel ?

'  Send home all those who are afraid to fight . </s>  "  For many of the people were frightened ,  as they looked at the host of their enemies ,  and the Lord knew that these men would only hinder the rest in the battle . </s>  So Gideon sent word through the camp :   " Whoever is afraid of the enemy may go home . "  And twenty-two thousand people went away ,  leaving only ten thousand in Gideon ' s army . </s>  But the army was stronger though it was smaller ,  for the cowards had gone ,  and only the brave men were left . </s>  But the Lord said to Gideon :   " The people are yet too many . You need only a few of the bravest and best men to fight in this battle . </s>  Bring the men down the mountain ,  past the water ,  and I will show you there how to find the men whom you need . </s>  "  In the morning Gideon ,  by God ' s command called his ten thousand men out ,  and made them march down the hill ,  just as though they were going to attack the enemy . </s>  And as they were beside the water ,  he noticed how they drank ,  and set them apart in two companies ,  according to their way of drinking . </s>  When they came to the water ,  most of the men threw aside their shields and spears ,  and knelt down and scooped up a draft of the water with both hands together like a cup . </s>  These men Gideon commanded to stand in one company . There were a few men who did not stop to take a large draft of water . </s>  Holding spear and shield in the right hand ,  to be ready for the enemy if one should suddenly appear ,  they merely caught up a handful of the water in passing and marched on ,  lapping up the water from one hand .

Krishna went under the bluish waters of Yamuna . </s>  On the shore ,  his friends      yelled in      terror but the boy raised his head and shouted back :       " Do not worry ,  I will soon be back with the ball !

An uncanny silence reigned over the whole      place . </s>  It seemed to be the kingdom of Death . Suddenly a strange sound caught Krishna ' s ears . It seemed like a hissing      sound .

 and on the way the snake began to  speak and said :   " Lita ,  you have saved my life ;  had you not come by ,  those men  would certainly have had my life ;  come with me to my home ,  where my father and  mother are ,  and I will give you anything you ask for ;  we have great  possessions . </s>  "  But Lita was afraid and said :   " When you get me there you will eat  me ,  or if you don’t ,  your father and mother will . </s>  "  But the snake protested that  it could not be guilty of such ingratitude and at last Lita agreed to accompany  it when he had left the other animals at his home . </s>  This he did and  set off alone with the snake ,  and after some days they reached the snake’s  home . </s>  The snake told Lita to wait outside while he went and apprized his  parents and he told Lita that when he was asked to choose his reward he should  name nothing but the ring which was on the father-snake’s finger ,  for the ring  had this property that if it were placed in a seer of milk and then asked to  produce anything whatever ,  that thing would immediately appear . </s>  Then the snake  went on to his home and when the father and mother saw him they fell on his  neck and kissed him and wept over him saying that they had never expected to  see him again ;  the snake told them how he had gone to the country of men and  how a reward had been set on his head and he had been hunted ,  and how Lita had  bought him from the men who would have killed him . </s>  The father snake asked why  he had not brought Lita to be rewarded and the snake said that he was afraid  that when they saw him they would eat him . </s>  But the father  and mother swore that they could not be guilty of such ingratitude ,  and when he  heard this the snake went and brought in Lita ,  and they entertained him  handsomely for two days ;  and on the third day the father snake asked Lita what  he would take as his reward . </s>  Lita looked round at the shining palace in which  they lived and at first was afraid to speak but at last he said :   " I do not want  money or anything but the ring on your finger :  if you will not give me that ,  I  will take nothing ;  I saved your son from peril and that you will remember all  your lives ,  and if you give me the ring I will honour you for it as long as I  live . </s>  "  Then the father and mother snake consulted together and the mother said   " Give it to him as he asks for it "  so the father snake drew it from his finger  and gave it to Lita and they gave him also some money for his journey back ;  and  he went home and found the other three animals safe and sound waiting for him . </s>  After a time his  father said that Lita must marry ;  so marriage go-betweens were sent out to look  for a bride and they found a very rich and beautiful girl whose parents were  agreeable to the match . </s>  But the girl herself said that she would only marry a  man who would build a covered passage from her house to his ,  so that she could  walk to her new home in the shade . </s>  The go-betweens reported this ,  and Lita’s  father and brothers consulted and agreed that they could never make such a  passage ,  but Lita said to his father :   " Arrange the match ;  it shall be my charge  to arrange for making the covered passage ;  I will not let you be put to shame  over it . </s>  "  For Lita had already put the ring to the test :  he had dropped it into  a seer of milk and said  " Let five bharias of parched rice and two bharias of  curds appear "  and immediately the parched rice and curds were before him ;  and  thereupon he had called out  " The snake has worthily rewarded me for saving his  life ;  "  and the cat and the otter and the rat overheard what he said . </s>  So the go-between  was told to arrange for the wedding to take place that very month ,  as Lita’s  birthday fell in the next month ,  which therefore was not suitable for his  wedding . </s>  Then the bride’s family sent him back to say that they were prepared  to send a string of nine knots ;  and the next day the go-between told this to  Lita’s family and they said that they were willing to accept it ;  so the  go-between brought a string of nine knots to signify that the wedding would  take place in nine days . </s>  The days passed by and Lita’s father and brothers  became very anxious because they saw no sign of the covered passage ;  but on the  very night before the wedding ,  Lita took his ring and ordered a covered passage  to be made from the one house to the other with a good path down the middle ;   and the next morning they found it made ;  and the bridegroom’s party passed  along it to the bride’s house and the bride was escorted home along it .

"  As soon ,  then ,  as he came to an inn he halted ,  and ate with great satisfaction all the bread he had brought with him for his noonday and evening meals ,  and washed it down with a glass of beer ,  to buy which he spent his two last farthings . </s>  This over ,  he drove his cow farther ,  but still in the direction of his mother ' s village . </s>  The heat meantime became more and more oppressive as noontime approached ,  and just then Hans came to a common which was an hour ' s journey across . </s>  Here he got into such a state of heat that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth ,  and he thought to himself :   " This wo not do ;  I will just milk my cow ,  and refresh myself . </s>  "  Hans ,  therefore tied her to a stump of a tree ,  and ,  having no pail ,  placed his leathern cap below ,  and set to work ,  but not a drop of milk could he squeeze out . </s>  He had placed himself ,  too ,  very awkwardly ,  and at last the impatient cow gave him such a kick on the head that he tumbled over on the ground ,  and for a long time knew not where he was . </s>  Fortunately ,  not many hours after ,  a Butcher passed by ,  trundling a young pig along upon a wheelbarrow . </s>  " What trick is this !

It is all very well when one can kill a beast like that at home ,  and make a profit of the flesh ;  but for my part I have no relish for cow ' s flesh ;  it is too tough for me !

They have sent out several people ,  and it would be a very bad job for you if they found you with the pig ;  the best thing you can do is to hide it in some dark corner !  "  Honest Hans was thunderstruck ,  and exclaimed ,   " Ah ,  Heaven help me in this fresh trouble !  you know the neighbourhood better than I do ;  do you take my pig and let me have your goose ,  "  said he to the boy .

I have not seen you a long time . </s>  "  Ananzi said ,   " I have been travelling about . "   " Oh !  But what have you got there ?  "  said the Lion . </s>  " Oh !  I have got my mother ' s bones—she has been dead these forty-eleven years ,  and they say I must not keep her here ,  so I am taking her up into the middle of the mountains to bury her . </s>  "  Then they parted . </s>  After he had gone a little way ,  the Lion said :   " I know that Ananzi is a great rogue ;  I dare say he has got something there that he does not want me to see ,  and I will just follow him ;  "  but he took care not to let Ananzi see him . </s>  Now ,  when Ananzi got into the wood ,  he set his sacks down ,  and took one fish out and began to eat ;  then a fly came ,  and Ananzi said ,   " I cannot eat any more ,  for there is some one near ;  "  so he tied the sack up ,  and went on farther into the mountains ,  where he set his sacks down ,  and took out two fish which he ate ;  and no fly came . </s>  He said ,   " There is no one near ;  "  so he took out more fish . </s>  But when he had eaten about half a dozen the Lion came up and said :   " Well ,  brother Ananzi ,  a pretty tale you have told me . </s>  "   " Oh !  brother Lion ,  I am so glad you have come ;  never mind what tale I have told you ,  but come and sit down—it was only my fun . </s>  "  So Lion sat down and began to eat ;  but before Ananzi had eaten two fish ,  Lion had emptied one of the sacks . </s>  Then said Ananzi to himself :   " Greedy fellow ,  eating up all my fish . </s>  "   " What do you say ,  sir ?  "   " I only said you do not eat half fast enough ,  "  for he was afraid the Lion would eat him up . </s>  Then they went on eating ,  but Ananzi wanted to revenge himself ,  and he said to the Lion ,   " Which of us do you think is the stronger ?  "  The Lion said ,   " Why ,  I am ,  of course . </s>  "  Then Ananzi said ,   " We will tie one another to the tree ,  and we shall see which is the stronger . </s>  "  Now they agreed that the Lion should tie Ananzi first ,  and he tied him with some very fine string ,  and did not tie him tight . </s>  Ananzi twisted himself about two or three times ,  and the string broke . Then it was Ananzi ' s turn to tie the Lion ,  and he took some very strong cord . </s>  The Lion said ,   " You must not tie me tight ,  for I did not tie you tight . "  And Ananzi said ,   " Oh !  no ,  to be sure ,  I will not . </s>  "  But he tied him as tight as ever he could ,  and then told him to try and get loose . The Lion tried and tried in vain—he could not get loose . </s>  Then Ananzi thought ,  now is my chance ;  so he got a big stick and beat him ,  and then went away and left him ,  for he was afraid to loose him lest he should kill him . </s>  Now there was a woman called Miss Nancy ,  who was going out one morning to get some  " callalou "   ( spinach )  in the wood ,  and as she was going she heard some one say ,   " Good morning ,  Miss Nancy !

"  and the Lion asked if he had seen Ananzi pass that way ,  but the old man said ,   " No ,  that fellow Ananzi is always meddling with some one ;  what mischief has he been up to now ?  "  Then the Lion told him ,  but the old man said it was no use to follow him any more ,  for he would never catch him ,  and so the Lion wished him good-day ,  and turned and went home again .

So she asked God to protect him ,  on condition that Napoleon should restore His holy religion ,  which was then cast to the ground . </s>  Well ,  that was agreed upon ,  and we shall see what came of it . " Follow me closely ,  and tell me if what you hear is in the nature or man . </s>  " Sure and certain it is that none but a man who conceived the idea of making a compact with God could have passed unhurt through the enemy ' s lines ,  through cannon-balls ,  and discharges of grape-shot that swept the rest of us off like flies ,  and always respected his head . </s>  I had proof of that—I myself—at Eylau . I see him now ,  as he rode up a height ,  took his field-glass ,  looked at the battle ,  and said ,   ' All goes well . </s>  '  One of those plumed busybodies ,  who plagued him considerably and followed him everywhere ,  even to his meals ,  so they said ,  thought to play the wag ,  and took the Emperor ' s place as he rode away . </s>  Ho !  in a twinkling ,  head and plume were off !  You must understand that Napoleon had promised to keep the secret of his compact all to himself . </s>  That ' s why all those who followed him ,  even his nearest friends ,  fell like nuts—Duroc ,  Bessières ,  Lannes—all strong as steel bars ,  though he could bend them as he pleased . </s>  Besides—to prove he was the child of God ,  and made to be the father of soldiers—was he ever known to be lieutenant or captain ?  No ,  no ;  commander-in-chief from the start . </s>  He did not look to be more than twenty-four years of age when he was an old general at the taking of Toulon ,  where he first began to show the others that they knew nothing about manoeuvring cannon . </s>  " After that ,  down came our slip of a general to command the grand army of Italy ,  which had not bread ,  nor munitions ,  nor shoes ,  nor coats—a poor army ,  as naked as a worm . </s>  ' My friends ,  '  said he ,   ' here we are together . </s>  Get it into your pates that fifteen days from now you will be conquerors—new clothes ,  good gaiters ,  famous shoes ,  and every man with a great-coat ;  but ,  my children ,  to get these things you must march to Milan ,  where they are . </s>  '  And we marched . France ,  crushed as flat as a bed-bug ,  straightened up . We were thirty thousand bare-feet against eighty thousand Austrian bullies ,  all fine men ,  well set-up . </s>  I see  ' em now !  But Napoleon—he was then only Bonaparte—he knew how to put the courage into us !  We marched by night ,  and we marched by day ;  we slapped their faces at Montenotte ,  we thrashed them at Rivoli ,  Lodi ,  Arcole ,  Millesimo ,  and we never let  ' em up . </s>  A soldier gets the taste of conquest . </s>  So Napoleon whirled round those Austrian generals ,  who did not know where to poke themselves to get out of his way ,  and he pelted  ' em well—nipped off ten thousand men at a blow sometimes ,  by getting round them with fifteen hundred Frenchmen ,  and then he gleaned as he pleased . </s>  He took their cannon ,  their supplies ,  their money ,  their munitions ,  in short ,  all they had that was good to take . </s>  He fought them and beat them on the mountains ,  he drove them into the rivers and seas ,  he bit  ' em in the air ,  he devoured  ' em on the ground ,  and he lashed  ' em everywhere . </s>  Hey !  the grand army feathered itself well ;  for ,  d ' ye see the Emperor ,  who was a wit ,  called up the inhabitants and told them he was there to deliver them . </s>  So after that the natives lodged and cherished us ;  the women too ,  and very judicious they were . Now here ' s the end of it . </s>  In Ventose ,   ' 96—in those times that was the month of March of to-day—we lay cuddled in a corner of Savoie with the marmots ;  and yet ,  before that campaign was over ,  we were masters of Italy ,  just as Napoleon had predicted ;  and by the following March—in a single year and two campaigns—he had brought us within sight of Vienna . </s>  ' Twas a clean sweep . We devoured their armies ,  one after the other ,  and made an end of four Austrian generals . </s>  One old fellow ,  with white hair ,  was roasted like a rat in the straw at Mantua . Kings begged for mercy on their knees !  Peace was won . </s>  " Could a man have done that ?  No ;  God helped him ,  to a certainty !   " He divided himself up like the loaves in the Gospel ,  commanded the battle by day ,  planned it by night ;  going and coming ,  for the sentinels saw him—never eating ,  never sleeping . </s>  So ,  seeing these prodigies ,  the soldiers adopted him for their father . </s>  Forward ,  march !  Then those others ,  the rulers in Paris ,  seeing this ,  said to themselves :   ' Here ' s a bold one that seems to get his orders from the skies ;  he ' s likely to put his paw on France . </s>  We must let him loose on Asia ;  we will send him to America ,  perhaps that will satisfy him . '  But  ' t was written above for him ,  as it was for Jesus Christ . </s>  The command went forth that he should go to Egypt . See ,  again ,  his resemblance to the Son of God . But that ' s not all . </s>  He called together his best veterans ,  his fire-eaters ,  the ones he had particularly put the devil into ,  and he said to them like this :   ' My friends ,  they have given us Egypt to chew up ,  just to keep us busy ,  but we will swallow it whole in a couple of campaigns ,  as we did Italy . </s>  The common soldiers shall be princes and have the land for their own . </s>  Forward ,  march !  '   ' Forward ,  march !  '  cried the sergeants ,  and there we were at Toulon ,  road to Egypt . </s>  At that time the English had all their ships in the sea ;  but when we embarked ,  Napoleon said :   ' They wo not see us . </s>  It is just as well that you should know from this time forth that your general has got his star in the sky ,  which guides and protects us . '  What was said was done . </s>  Passing over the sea ,  we took Malta like an orange ,  just to quench his thirst for victory ;  for he was a man who could not live and do nothing . </s>  " So here we are in Egypt . Good . Once here ,  other orders . </s>  The Egyptians ,  d ' ye see ,  are men who ,  ever since the earth was ,  have had giants for sovereigns ,  and armies as numerous as ants ;  for ,  you must understand ,  that ' s the land of genii and crocodiles ,  where they have built pyramids as big as our mountains ,  and buried their kings under them to keep them fresh—an idea that pleased  ' em mightily . </s>  So then ,  after we disembarked ,  the Little Corporal said to us :   ' My children ,  the country you are going to conquer has a lot of gods that you must respect ;  because Frenchmen ought to be friends with everybody ,  and fight the nations without vexing the inhabitants . </s>  Get it into your skulls that you are not to touch anything at first ,  for it is all going to be yours soon .

When he grew older ,  Siegfried would ride into the country ,  yet always would he be attended by King Siegmund ' s most trusted warriors . </s>  Then one day armed men entered the Netherlands ,  the country over which the King Siegmund ruled ,  and the little Prince was sent away from the castle ,  lest by any evil chance he should fall into the hands of the foe . </s>  Siegfried was hidden away safe in the thickets of a great forest ,  and dwelt there under the care of a blacksmith ,  named Mimer . </s>  Mimer was a dwarf ,  belonging to a strange race of little folk called Nibelungs . The Nibelungs lived for the most part in a dark little town beneath the ground . </s>  Nibelheim was the name of this little town and many of the tiny men who dwelt there were smiths . </s>  All the livelong day they would hammer on their little anvils ,  but all through the long night they would dance and play with tiny little Nibelung women . </s>  It was not in the little dark town of Nibelung that Mimer had his forge ,  but under the trees of the great forest to which Siegfried had been sent . </s>  As Mimer or his pupils wielded their tools the wild beasts would start from their lair ,  and the swift birds would wing their flight through the mazes of the wood ,  lest danger lay in those heavy ,  resounding strokes . </s>  But Siegfried ,  the hero-boy ,  would laugh for glee ,  and seizing the heaviest hammer he could see he would swing it with such force upon the anvil that it would be splintered into a thousand pieces . </s>  Then Mimer the blacksmith would scold the lad ,  who was now the strongest of all the lads under his care ;  but little heeding his rebukes ,  Siegfried would fling himself merrily out of the smithy and hasten with great strides into the gladsome wood . </s>  For now the Prince was growing a big lad ,  and his strength was even as the strength of ten . To-day Siegfried was in a merry mood . He would repay Mimer ' s rebukes in right good fashion . </s>  He would frighten the little blacksmith dwarf until he was forced to cry for mercy . </s>  Clad in his forest dress of deerskins ,  with his hair as burnished gold blowing around his shoulders ,  Siegfried wandered away into the depths of the woodland . </s>  There he seized the silver horn which hung from his girdle and raised it to his lips . </s>  A long ,  clear note he blew ,  and ere the sound had died away the boy saw a sight which pleased him well . </s>  Here was good prey indeed !  A bear ,  a great big shaggy bear was peering at him out of a bush ,  and as he gazed the beast opened its jaws and growled ,  a fierce and angry growl . </s>  Not a whit afraid was Siegfried . </s>  Quick as lightning he had caught the great creature in his arms ,  and ere it could turn upon him ,  it was muzzled ,  and was being led quietly along toward the smithy . </s>  Mimer was busy at his forge sharpening a sword when Siegfried reached the doorway . At the sound of laughter the little dwarf raised his head . It was the Prince who laughed . </s>  Then Mimer saw the bear ,  and letting the sword he held drop to the ground with a clang ,  he ran to hide himself in the darkest corner of the smithy . Then Siegfried laughed again . </s>  He was no hero-boy to-day ,  for next he made the big bear hunt the little Nibelung dwarf from corner to corner ,  nor could the frightened little man escape or hide himself in darkness . </s>  Again and again as he crouched in a shadowed corner ,  Siegfried would stir up the embers of the forge until all the smithy was lighted with a ruddy glow . </s>  At length the Prince tired of his game ,  and unmuzzling the bear he chased the bewildered beast back into the shelter of the woodland . </s>  Mimer ,  poor little dwarf ,  all a-tremble with his fear ,  cried angrily ,   " Thou mayest go shoot if so it please thee ,  and bring home thy dead prey . </s>  Dead bears thou mayest bring hither if thou wilt ,  but live bears shalt thou leave to crouch in their lair or to roam through the forest . </s>  "  But Siegfried ,  the naughty Prince ,  only laughed at the little Nibelung ' s frightened face and harsh ,  croaking voice . </s>  Now as the days passed ,  Mimer the blacksmith began to wish that Siegfried had never come to dwell with him in his smithy . </s>  The Prince was growing too strong ,  too brave to please the little dwarf ;  moreover ,  many were the mischievous tricks his pupil played on him . </s>  Prince though he was ,  Mimer would see if he could not get rid of his tormentor . </s>  For indeed though ,  as I have told you ,  Siegfried had a heart of gold ,  at this time the gold seemed to have grown dim and tarnished . </s>  Perhaps that was because the Prince had learned to distrust and to dislike ,  nay ,  more ,  to hate the little ,  cunning dwarf . </s>  However that may be ,  it is certain that Siegfried played many pranks upon the little Nibelung ,  and he ,  Mimer ,  determined to get rid of the quick-tempered ,  strong-handed Prince . </s>  One day ,  therefore ,  it happened that the little dwarf told Siegfried to go deep into the forest to bring home charcoal for the forge . </s>  And this Mimer did ,  though he knew that in the very part of the forest to which he was sending the lad there dwelt a terrible dragon ,  named Regin . </s>  Indeed Regin was a brother of the little blacksmith ,  and would be lying in wait for the Prince . </s>  It would be but the work of a moment for the monster to seize the lad and greedily to devour him . To Siegfried it was always joy to wander afar through the woodland . </s>  Ofttimes had he thrown himself down on the soft ,  moss-covered ground and lain there hour after hour ,  listening to the wood-bird ' s song . </s>  Sometimes he would even find a reed and try to pipe a tune as sweet as did the birds ,  but that was all in vain ,  as the lad soon found . </s>  No tiny songster would linger to hearken to the shrill piping of his grassy reed ,  and the Prince himself was soon ready to fling it far away . </s>  It was no hardship then to Siegfried to leave the forge and the hated little Nibelung ,  therefore it was that with right good will he set out in search of charcoal for Mimer the blacksmith . </s>  As he loitered there where the trees grew thickest ,  Siegfried took his horn and blew it lustily . </s>  If he could not pipe on a grassy reed ,  at least he could blow a rousing note on his silver horn . </s>  Suddenly ,  as Siegfried blew ,  the trees seemed to sway ,  the earth to give out fire . </s>  Regin ,  the dragon ,  had roused himself at the blast ,  and was even now drawing near to the Prince . </s>  It was at the mighty strides of the monster that the trees had seemed to tremble ,  it was as he opened his terrible jaws that the earth had seemed to belch out fire . </s>  For a little while Siegfried watched the dragon in silence . Then he laughed aloud ,  and a brave ,  gay laugh it was . </s>  Alone in the forest ,  with a sword ,  buckled to his side ,  the hero was afraid of naught ,  not even of Regin . </s>  The ugly monster was sitting now on a little hillock ,  looking down upon the lad ,  his victim as he thought . </s>  Then Siegfried called boldly to the dragon ,   " I will kill thee ,  for in truth thou art an ugly monster .

The envoy said nothing . </s>  He advanced to the throne where the king was awaiting him ,  and stooping down ,  traced on the floor with a rod which he held in his hand a black circle all round it . </s>  Then he sat down on a seat that was near ,  and took no further notice of anyone . </s>  The king and his courtiers were equally mystified and enraged at this strange behaviour ,  but the envoy sat as calm and still as an image ,  and it soon became plain that they would get no explanation from him . </s>  The ministers were hastily summoned to a council ,  but not one of them could throw any light upon the subject . </s>  This made the king more angry than ever ,  and he told them that unless before sunset they could find someone capable of solving the mystery he would hang them all . </s>  The king was ,  as the ministers knew ,  a man of his word ;  and they quickly mapped out the city into districts ,  so that they might visit house by house ,  and question the occupants as to whether they could fathom the action of the ambassador . </s>  Most of them received no reply except a puzzled stare ;  but ,  luckily ,  one of them was more observant than the rest ,  and on entering an empty cottage where a swing was swinging of itself ,  he began to think it might be worth while for him to see the owner . </s>  Opening a door leading into another room ,  he found a second swing ,  swinging gently like the first ,  and from the window he beheld a patch of corn ,  and a willow which moved perpetually without any wind ,  in order to frighten away the sparrows . </s>  Feeling more and more curious ,  he descended the stairs and found himself in a large light workshop in which was seated a weaver at his loom . </s>  But all the weaver did was to guide his threads ,  for the machine that he had invented to set in motion the swings and the willow pole made the loom work . </s>  When he saw the great wheel standing in the corner ,  and had guessed the use of it ,  the merchant heaved a sigh of relief . </s>  At any rate ,  if the weaver could not guess the riddle ,  he at least might put the minister on the right track . </s>  So without more ado he told the story of the circle ,  and ended by declaring that the person who could explain its meaning should be handsomely rewarded . </s>  ' Come with me at once ,  '  he said .

'   ' The meaning ,  O king ,  '  replied the weaver ,   ' is this :  The circle drawn by the envoy round your throne is the message of the emperor ,  and signifies ,   " If I send an army and surround your capital ,  will you lay down your arms ?  "  The knuckle-bones which I placed before him told him ,   " You are but children in comparison with us . </s>  Toys like these are the only playthings you are fit for . </s>  "  The millet that he scattered was an emblem of the number of soldiers that his master can bring into the field ;  but by the hen which ate up the seed he understood that one of our men could destroy a host of theirs . </s>  '   ' I do not think ,  '  he added ,   ' that the emperor will declare war . </s>  '   ' You have saved me and my honour ,  '  cried the king ,   ' and wealth and glory shall be heaped upon you . </s>  Name your reward ,  and you shall have it even to the half of my kingdom . </s>  '   ' The small farm outside the city gates ,  as a marriage portion for my daughter ,  is all I ask ,  '  answered the weaver ,  and it was all he would accept .

Your head shall pay for it !  '  cried he ;  and bade the courtiers instantly summon the executioner to the palace . </s>  But of course somebody ran at once to the queen ,  and told her of the king ' s order ,  and she put common clothes on the prince ,  and filled his pockets with gold ,  and hurried him on board a ship which was sailing that night for a distant island . </s>  ' Your father will repent some day ,  and then he will be thankful to know you are alive ,  '  said she . </s>  ' But one last counsel will I give you ,  and that is ,  take no man into your service who desires to be paid every month .

It was full of hills and woods and flowers ,  and beautiful white houses stood everywhere in gardens . </s>  ' What a charming spot to live in ,  '  thought the prince .

'  inquired the prince ,  when he had questioned the new-comer and found him suitable . </s>  ' I do not want money ,  '  answered the Arab ;   ' at the end of a year you can see what my services are worth to you ,  and can pay me in any way you like . </s>  '  And the young man was pleased ,  and took the Arab for his servant . </s>  Now ,  although no one would have guessed it from the look of the side of the island where the prince had landed ,  the other part was a complete desert ,  owing to the ravages of a horrible monster which came up from the sea ,  and devoured all the corn and cattle . </s>  The governor had sent bands of soldiers to lie in wait for the creature in order to kill it ;  but ,  somehow ,  no one ever happened to be awake at the moment that the ravages were committed . </s>  It was in vain that the sleepy soldiers were always punished severely—the same thing invariably occurred next time ;  and at last heralds were sent throughout the island to offer a great reward to the man who could slay the monster . </s>  As soon as the Arab heard the news ,  he went straight to the governor ' s palace . </s>  ' If my master can succeed in killing the monster ,  what reward will you give him ?

'  At this salutation from a stranger the queen grew silent ,  dreading she knew not what . </s>  The farmer finds the queen weeping by the palanquin  ' Oh ,  you that weep ,  '  repeated the farmer ,   ' fear not to speak to me ,  for you are to me as a daughter . </s>  Tell me ,  who are you ?  '  His voice was so kind that the queen gathered up her courage and spoke . </s>  And when she had told her story ,  the farmer called his wife ,  who led her to their house ,  and gave her food to eat ,  and a bed to lie on . </s>  And in the farm ,  a few days later ,  a little prince was born ,  and by his mother ' s wish named Ameer Ali .

Where am I to get a fresh pitcher instead of this one that you have broken with your foolish tricks ?  And how am I to go so far for water twice when one journey wearies me ?  '  Water pours over the old woman from the hole in the pot  ' But ,  mother ,  '  replied the prince ,   ' I played no trick upon you !  I did but shoot at a pigeon that should have served me for dinner ,  and as my pellet missed it ,  it must have broken your pitcher . </s>  But ,  in exchange ,  you shall have my brass pot ,  and that will not break easily ;  and as for getting water ,  tell me where to find it ,  and I will fetch it while you dry your garments in the sun ,  and carry it whither you will . </s>  '  At this the old woman ' s face brightened . </s>  She showed him where to seek the water ,  and when he returned a few minutes later with his pot filled to the brim ,  she led the way without a word ,  and he followed . </s>  In a short while they came to a hut in the forest ,  and as they drew near it Ameer Ali beheld in the doorway the loveliest damsel his eyes had ever looked on . </s>  At the sight of a stranger she drew her veil about her and stepped into the hut ,  and much as he wished to see her again Ameer Ali could think of no excuse by which to bring her back ,  and so ,  with a heavy heart ,  he made his salutation ,  and bade the old woman farewell .

"   " Why ,  "  said Fin ,   " ever since I was the height of a round tower ,  I was known to be fond of having a good prospect of my own ;  and where the dickens ,  neighbours ,  could I find a better spot for a good prospect than the top of Knockmany ?  As for water ,  I am sinking a pump ,  and ,  plase goodness ,  as soon as the Causeway ' s made ,  I intend to finish it . </s>  "  Now ,  this was more of Fin ' s philosophy ;  for the real state of the case was ,  that he pitched upon the top of Knockmany in order that he might be able to see Cucullin coming towards the house . </s>  All we have to say is ,  that if he wanted a spot from which to keep a sharp look-out -- and ,  between ourselves ,  he did want it grievously -- barring Slieve Croob ,  or Slieve Donard ,  or its own cousin ,  Cullamore ,  he could not find a neater or more convenient situation for it in the sweet and sagacious province of Ulster . </s>  " God save all here !

Fin was a proof of this . </s>  " It ' s this Cucullin ,  "  said he ,   " that ' s troubling me . </s>  When the fellow gets angry ,  and begins to stamp ,  he will shake you a whole townland ;  and it ' s well known that he can stop a thunderbolt ,  for he always carries one about him in the shape of a pancake ,  to show to any one that might misdoubt it . </s>  "  As he spoke ,  he clapped his thumb in his mouth ,  which he always did when he wanted to prophesy ,  or to know anything that happened in his absence ;  and the wife asked him what he did it for . </s>  " He ' s coming ,  "  said Fin ;   " I see him below Dungannon . </s>  "   " Thank goodness ,  dear !  an '  who is it ,  avick ?  Glory be to God !

" To-morrow ,  about two o ' clock ,  "  replied Fin ,  with a groan . </s>  " Well ,  my bully ,  do not be cast down ,  "  said Oonagh ;   " depend on me ,  and maybe I will bring you better out of this scrape than ever you could bring yourself ,  by your rule o '  thumb . </s>  "  She then made a high smoke on the top of the hill ,  after which she put her finger in her mouth ,  and gave three whistles ,  and by that Cucullin knew he was invited to Cullamore -- for this was the way that the Irish long ago gave a sign to all strangers and travellers ,  to let them know they were welcome to come and take share of whatever was going . </s>  In the meantime ,  Fin was very melancholy ,  and did not know what to do ,  or how to act at all . </s>  Cucullin was an ugly customer to meet with ;  and ,  the idea of the  " cake "  aforesaid flattened the very heart within him . </s>  What chance could he have ,  strong and brave though he was ,  with a man who could ,  when put in a passion ,  walk the country into earthquakes and knock thunderbolts into pancakes ?  Fin knew not on what hand to turn him . </s>  Right or left -- backward or forward -- where to go he could form no guess whatsoever . </s>  " Oonagh ,  "  said he ,   " can you do nothing for me ?  Where ' s all your invention ?  Am I to be skivered like a rabbit before your eyes ,  and to have my name disgraced for ever in the sight of all my tribe ,  and me the best man among them ?

"  And the soothsayer went forth out of the house and he was not long outside when he returned . </s>  " Well ,  "  said the soothsayer ,   " I saw in my second sight that it is on account of a daughter of yours that the greatest amount of blood shall be shed that has ever been shed in Erin since time and race began . </s>  And the three most famous heroes that ever were found will lose their heads on her account . </s>  "  After a time a daughter was born to Malcolm ,  he did not allow a living being to come to his house ,  only himself and the nurse . </s>  He asked this woman ,   " Will you yourself bring up the child to keep her in hiding far away where eye will not see a sight of her nor ear hear a word about her ?

A certain friend of mine ,  living abroad ,  is amiable enough to write to me about once in a fortnight . </s>  Thus ,  when fourteen days or thereabouts have elapsed since I last heard from him ,  my mind ,  probably ,  either consciously or subconsciously ,  is expectant of a letter from him . </s>  One night last week I dreamed that as I was going upstairs to dress for dinner I heard ,  as I often heard ,  the sound of the postman ' s knock on my front door ,  and diverted my direction downstairs instead . </s>  There ,  among other correspondence ,  was a letter from him . </s>  Thereafter the fantastic entered ,  for on opening it I found inside the ace of diamonds ,  and scribbled across it in his well-known handwriting ,   " I am sending you this for safe custody ,  as you know it is running an unreasonable risk to keep aces in Italy . </s>  "  The next evening I was just preparing to go upstairs to dress when I heard the postman ' s knock ,  and did precisely as I had done in my dream . </s>  There ,  among other letters ,  was one from my friend . Only it did not contain the ace of diamonds . </s>  Had it done so ,  I should have attached more weight to the matter ,  which ,  as it stands ,  seems to me a perfectly ordinary coincidence . </s>  No doubt I consciously or subconsciously expected a letter from him ,  and this suggested to me my dream . </s>  Similarly ,  the fact that my friend had not written to me for a fortnight suggested to him that he should do so . </s>  But occasionally it is not so easy to find such an explanation ,  and for the following story I can find no explanation at all . </s>  It came out of the dark ,  and into the dark it has gone again . </s>  All my life I have been a habitual dreamer :  the nights are few ,  that is to say ,  when I do not find on awaking in the morning that some mental experience has been mine ,  and sometimes ,  all night long ,  apparently ,  a series of the most dazzling adventures befall me . </s>  Almost without exception these adventures are pleasant ,  though often merely trivial . It is of an exception that I am going to speak . </s>  It was when I was about sixteen that a certain dream first came to me ,  and this is how it befell . </s>  It opened with my being set down at the door of a big red-brick house ,  where ,  I understood ,  I was going to stay . </s>  The servant who opened the door told me that tea was being served in the garden ,  and led me through a low dark-panelled hall ,  with a large open fireplace ,  on to a cheerful green lawn set round with flower beds . </s>  There were grouped about the tea-table a small party of people ,  but they were all strangers to me except one ,  who was a schoolfellow called Jack Stone ,  clearly the son of the house ,  and he introduced me to his mother and father and a couple of sisters . </s>  I was ,  I remember ,  somewhat astonished to find myself here ,  for the boy in question was scarcely known to me ,  and I rather disliked what I knew of him ;  moreover ,  he had left school nearly a year before . </s>  The afternoon was very hot ,  and an intolerable oppression reigned . </s>  On the far side of the lawn ran a red-brick wall ,  with an iron gate in its center ,  outside which stood a walnut tree . </s>  We sat in the shadow of the house opposite a row of long windows ,  inside which I could see a table with cloth laid ,  glimmering with glass and silver . </s>  This garden front of the house was very long ,  and at one end of it stood a tower of three stories ,  which looked to me much older than the rest of the building . </s>  Before long ,  Mrs . </s>  Stone ,  who ,  like the rest of the party ,  had sat in absolute silence ,  said to me ,   " Jack will show you your room :  I have given you the room in the tower . </s>  "  Quite inexplicably my heart sank at her words . I felt as if I had known that I should have the room in the tower ,  and that it contained something dreadful and significant . </s>  Jack instantly got up ,  and I understood that I had to follow him . </s>  In silence we passed through the hall ,  and mounted a great oak staircase with many corners ,  and arrived at a small landing with two doors set in it . </s>  He pushed one of these open for me to enter ,  and without coming in himself ,  closed it after me . </s>  Then I knew that my conjecture had been right :  there was something awful in the room ,  and with the terror of nightmare growing swiftly and enveloping me ,  I awoke in a spasm of terror . </s>  Now that dream or variations on it occurred to me intermittently for fifteen years . </s>  Most often it came in exactly this form ,  the arrival ,  the tea laid out on the lawn ,  the deadly silence succeeded by that one deadly sentence ,  the mounting with Jack Stone up to the room in the tower where horror dwelt ,  and it always came to a close in the nightmare of terror at that which was in the room ,  though I never saw what it was . </s>  At other times I experienced variations on this same theme . </s>  Occasionally ,  for instance ,  we would be sitting at dinner in the dining-room ,  into the windows of which I had looked on the first night when the dream of this house visited me ,  but wherever we were ,  there was the same silence ,  the same sense of dreadful oppression and foreboding . </s>  And the silence I knew would always be broken by Mrs . Stone saying to me ,   " Jack will show you your room :  I have given you the room in the tower . </s>  "  Upon which  ( this was invariable )  I had to follow him up the oak staircase with many corners ,  and enter the place that I dreaded more and more each time that I visited it in sleep . </s>  Or ,  again ,  I would find myself playing cards still in silence in a drawing-room lit with immense chandeliers ,  that gave a blinding illumination . </s>  What the game was I have no idea ;  what I remember ,  with a sense of miserable anticipation ,  was that soon Mrs . </s>  Stone would get up and say to me ,   " Jack will show you your room :  I have given you the room in the tower . </s>  "  This drawing-room where we played cards was next to the dining-room ,  and ,  as I have said ,  was always brilliantly illuminated ,  whereas the rest of the house was full of dusk and shadows . </s>  And yet ,  how often ,  in spite of those bouquets of lights ,  have I not pored over the cards that were dealt me ,  scarcely able for some reason to see them . </s>  Their designs ,  too ,  were strange :  there were no red suits ,  but all were black ,  and among them there were certain cards which were black all over . I hated and dreaded those . </s>  As this dream continued to recur ,  I got to know the greater part of the house . There was a smoking-room beyond the drawing-room ,  at the end of a passage with a green baize door . </s>

'  Then the shepherd stretched his staff out over the flames and the snake wound itself round the staff and up to his hand ,  and from his hand it crept up his arm ,  and twined itself about his neck . </s>  The shepherd trembled with fright ,  expecting every instant to be stung to death ,  and said :   ' What an unlucky man I am !  Did I rescue you only to be destroyed myself ?  '  But the snake answered :   ' Have no fear ;  only carry me home to my father who is the King of the Snakes . </s>  '  The shepherd ,  however ,  was much too frightened to listen ,  and said that he could not go away and leave his flock alone ;  but the snake said :   ' You need not be afraid to leave your flock ,  no evil shall befall them ;  but make all the haste you can . </s>  '  So he set off through the wood carrying the snake ,  and after a time he came to a great gateway ,  made entirely of snakes intertwined one with another . </s>  The shepherd stood still with surprise ,  but the snake round his neck whistled ,  and immediately all the arch unwound itself . </s>  ' When we are come to my father ' s house ,  '  said his own snake to him ,   ' he will reward you with anything you like to ask -- silver ,  gold ,  jewels ,  or whatever on this earth is most precious ;  but take none of all these things ,  ask rather to understand the language of beasts . </s>  He will refuse it to you a long time ,  but in the end he will grant it to you . </s>  '  Soon after that they arrived at the house of the King of the Snakes ,  who burst into tears of joy at the sight of his daughter ,  as he had given her up for dead . </s>  ' Where have you been all this time ?  '  he asked ,  directly he could speak ,  and she told him that she had been caught in a forest fire ,  and had been rescued from the flames by the shepherd . </s>  The King of the Snakes ,  then turning to the shepherd ,  said to him :   ' What reward will you choose for saving my child ?

'  The master answered :   ' Do as I bid you '  ;  and made ready to return home with his wife ,  and they mounted their horses ,  her steed being a mare . </s>  As they went on their way ,  it happened that the husband rode on ahead ,  while the wife was a little way behind . </s>  The husband ' s horse ,  seeing this ,  neighed ,  and said to the mare :   ' Come along ,  make haste ;  why are you so slow ?  '  And the mare answered :   ' It is very easy for you ,  you carry only your master ,  who is a thin man ,  but I carry my mistress ,  who is so fat that she weights as much as three . </s>  '  When the husband heard that he looked back and laughed ,  which the wife perceiving ,  she urged on the mare till she caught up with her husband ,  and asked him why he laughed .

'  said the son ,   ' and ,  anyway ,  I will have my will for once . </s>  '  And he killed all the sheep and laid them on the grass . But he cut off the head of the ram which always led the flock and had bells round its horns . </s>  This he took back to the place where they should have been feeding ,  for here he had noticed a high rock ,  with a patch of green grass in the middle and two or three thick bushes growing on the edge . </s>  Up this rock he climbed with great difficulty ,  and fastened the ram ' s head to the bushes with a cord ,  leaving only the tips of the horns with the bells visible . </s>  As there was a soft breeze blowing ,  the bushes to which the head was tied moved gently ,  and the bells rang .

Why ,  it would not buy even a slice of bacon .

' Oh ,  my friend ,  there is plenty the matter ,  '  answered Peter . </s>  ' I have gained a nut as my wages ,  and when I cracked it this crowd of beasts came out ,  and I do not know what to do with them all !  '   ' Listen to me ,  my son ,  '  said Eisenkopf . </s>  ' If you will promise never to marry I will drive them all back into the nut again . </s>  '  In his trouble Peter would have promised far harder things than this ,  so he gladly gave the promise Eisenkopf asked for ;  and at a whistle from the stranger the animals all began crowding into the nut again ,  nearly tumbling over each other in their haste . </s>  When the last foot had got inside ,  the two halves of the shell shut close .

'  he gasped ,  as soon as he could speak ;  and the son told him the whole story ,  and of the promise he had given Eisenkopf . </s>  The next day some of the cattle were driven to market and sold ,  and with the money the old man was able to buy some of the fields and gardens round his house ,  and in a few months had grown the richest and most prosperous man in the whole village . </s>  Everything seemed to turn to gold in his hands ,  till one day ,  when he and his son were sitting in the orchard watching their herds of cattle grazing in the meadows ,  he suddenly said :   ' Peter ,  my boy ,  it is time that you were thinking of marrying . </s>  '   ' But ,  my dear father ,  I told you I can never marry ,  because of the promise I gave to Eisenkopf . </s>  '   ' Oh ,  one promises here and promises there ,  but no one ever thinks of keeping such promises . </s>  If Eisenkopf does not like your marrying ,  he will have to put up with it all the same !

'  he would wave his hand graciously or nod in a condescending way ;  and if his master happened to say to him ,  as he sometimes did ,   ' Really ,  Labakan ,  you look like a prince ,  '  he was delighted ,  and would answer ,   ' Have you noticed it too ?  '  or  ' Well ,  so I have long thought . </s>  '  Things went on like this for some time ,  and the master put up with Labakan ' s absurdities because he was ,  on the whole ,  a good fellow and a clever workman . </s>  One day ,  the sultan ' s brother happened to be passing through Alexandria ,  and wanted to have one of his state robes altered ,  so he sent for the master tailor ,  who handed the robe over to Labakan as his best workman . </s>  In the evening ,  when every one had left the workshop and gone home ,  a great longing drove Labakan back to the place where the royal robe hung . </s>  He stood a long time gazing at it ,  admiring the rich material and the splendid embroidery in it . At last he could hold out no longer . </s>  He felt he must try it on ,  and lo !  and behold ,  it fitted as though it had been made for him . </s>  ' Am not I as good a prince as any other ?  '  he asked himself ,  as he proudly paced up and down the room . </s>  ' Has not the master often said that I seemed born to be a prince ?  '  It seemed to him that he must be the son of some unknown monarch ,  and at last he determined to set out at once and travel in search of his proper rank . </s>  He felt as if the splendid robe had been sent him by some kind fairy ,  and he took care not to neglect such a precious gift . </s>  He collected all his savings ,  and ,  concealed by the darkness of the night ,  he passed through the gates of Alexandria . </s>  The new prince excited a good deal of curiosity where ever he went ,  for his splendid robe and majestic manner did not seem quite suitable to a person travelling on foot . </s>  If anyone asked questions ,  he only replied with an important air of mystery that he had his own reasons for not riding . </s>  However ,  he soon found out that walking made him ridiculous ,  so at last he bought a quiet ,  steady old horse ,  which he managed to get cheap . </s>  One day ,  as he was ambling along upon Murva  ( that was the horse ' s name )  ,  a horseman overtook him and asked leave to join him ,  so that they might both beguile the journey with pleasant talk . </s>  The newcomer was a bright ,  cheerful ,  good-looking young man ,  who soon plunged into conversation and asked many questions . </s>  He told Labakan that his own name was Omar ,  that he was a nephew of Elfi Bey ,  and was travelling in order to carry out a command given him by his uncle on his death bed . </s>  Labakan was not quite so open in his confidences ,  but hinted that he too was of noble birth and was travelling for pleasure . </s>  The two young men took a fancy to each other and rode on together . </s>  On the second day of their journey Labakan questioned Omar as to the orders he had to carry out ,  and to his surprise heard this tale . </s>  Elfi Bey ,  Pacha of Cairo ,  had brought up Omar from his earliest childhood ,  and the boy had never known his parents . </s>  On his deathbed Elfi Bey called Omar to him ,  and then told him that he was not his nephew ,  but the son of a great king ,  who ,  having been warned of coming dangers by his astrologers ,  had sent the young prince away and made a vow not to see him till his twenty-second birthday . </s>  Elfi Bey did not tell Omar his father ' s name ,  but expressly desired him to be at a great pillar four days '  journey east of Alexandria on the fourth day of the coming month ,  on which day he would be twenty-two years old . </s>  Here he would meet some men ,  to whom he was to hand a dagger which Elfi Bey gave him ,  and to say  ' Here am I for whom you seek . </s>  '  If they answered :   ' Praised be the Prophet who has preserved you ,  '  he was to follow them ,  and they would take him to his father . </s>  Labakan was greatly surprised and interested by this story ,  but after hearing it he could not help looking on Prince Omar with envious eyes ,  angry that his friend should have the position he himself longed so much for . </s>  He began to make comparisons between the prince and himself ,  and was obliged to confess that he was a fine-looking young man with very good manners and a pleasant expression . </s>  At the same time ,  he felt sure that had he been in the prince ' s place any royal father might have been glad to own him . </s>  These thoughts haunted him all day ,  and he dreamt them all night . </s>  He woke very early ,  and as he saw Omar sleeping quietly ,  with a happy smile on his face ,  a wish arose in his mind to take by force or by cunning the things which an unkind fate had denied him . </s>  The dagger which was to act as a passport was sticking in Omar ' s girdle . </s>  Labakan drew it gently out ,  and hesitated for a moment whether or not to plunge it into the heart of the sleeping prince . </s>  However ,  he shrank from the idea of murder ,  so he contented himself with placing the dagger in his own belt ,  and ,  saddling Omar ' s swift horse for himself ,  was many miles away before the prince woke up to realise his losses . </s>  For two days Labakan rode on steadily ,  fearing lest ,  after all ,  Omar might reach the meeting place before him . </s>  At the end of the second day he saw the great pillar at a distance . </s>  It stood on a little hill in the middle of a plain ,  and could be seen a very long way off . Labakan ' s heart beat fast at the sight . </s>  Though he had had some time in which to think over the part he meant to play his conscience made him rather uneasy . </s>  However ,  the thought that he must certainly have been born to be a king supported him ,  and he bravely rode on . </s>  The neighbourhood was quite bare and desert ,  and it was a good thing that the new prince had brought food for some time with him ,  as two days were still wanting till the appointed time . </s>  Towards the middle of the next day he saw a long procession of horses and camels coming towards him .

' But it is your affair ,  not mine . </s>  So good-morning ,  '  and on he went .

In vain had he sent arrow after arrow at the beautiful stag . </s>  Every shot fell short ,  or went wide of the mark ;  and at last ,  just as darkness was setting in ,  he lost sight altogether of the beast . </s>  By this time his horse could hardly move from fatigue ,  his hound staggered panting along beside him ,  he was far away amongst mountains where he had never been before ,  and had quite missed his way ,  and not a human creature or dwelling was in sight . </s>  All this was very discouraging ,  but the king would not have minded if he had not lost that beautiful stag . </s>  That troubled him a good deal ,  but he never worried over what he could not help ,  so he got down from his horse ,  slipped his arm through the bridle ,  and led the animal along the rough path in hopes of discovering some shepherd ' s hut ,  or ,  at least ,  a cave or shelter under some rock ,  where he might pass the night . </s>  Presently he heard the sound of rushing water ,  and made towards it . </s>  He toiled over a steep rocky shoulder of a hill ,  and there ,  just below him ,  was a stream dashing down a precipitous glen ,  and ,  almost beneath his feet ,  twinkling and flickering from the level of the torrent ,  was a dim light as of a lamp . </s>  Towards this light the king with his horse and hound made his way ,  sliding and stumbling down a steep ,  stony path . </s>  At the bottom the king found a narrow grassy ledge by the brink of the stream ,  across which the light from a rude lantern in the mount of a cave shed a broad beam of uncertain light . </s>  At the edge of the stream sat an old hermit with a long white beard ,  who neither spoke nor moved as the king approached ,  but sat throwing into the stream dry leaves which lay scattered about the ground near him . </s>  ' Peace be upon you ,  '  said the king ,  giving the usual country salutation . </s>  ' And upon you peace ,  '  answered the hermit ;  but still he never looked up ,  nor stopped what he was doing . For a minute or two the king stood watching him . </s>  He noticed that the hermit threw two leaves in at a time ,  and watched them attentively . </s>  Sometimes both were carried rapidly down by the stream ;  sometimes only one leaf was carried off ,  and the other ,  after whirling slowly round and round on the edge of the current ,  would come circling back on an eddy to the hermit ' s feet . </s>  At other times both leaves were held in the backward eddy ,  and failed to reach the main current of the noisy stream . </s>  ' What are you doing ?  '  asked the king at last ,  and the hermit replied that he was reading the fates of men ;  every one ' s fate ,  he said ,  was settled from the beginning ,  and ,  whatever it were ,  there was no escape from it . </s>  The king laughed . ' I care little ,  '  he said ,   ' what my fate may be ;  but I should be curious to know the fate of my little daughter . </s>  '   ' I cannot say ,  '  answered the hermit .

'  demanded the king . </s>  ' I might know ,  '  returned the hermit ,   ' but it is not always wisdom to know much . </s>  '  But the king was not content with this reply ,  and began to press the old man to say what he knew ,  which for a long time he would not do . </s>  At last ,  however ,  the king urged him so greatly that he said :   ' The king ' s daughter will marry the son of a poor slave-girl called Puruna ,  who belongs to the king of the land of the north . </s>  There is no escaping from Fate . </s>  '  The king was wild with anger at hearing these words ,  but he was also very tired ;  so he only laughed ,  and answered that he hoped there would be a way out of THAT fate anyhow . </s>  Then he asked if the hermit could shelter him and his beasts for the night ,  and the hermit said  ' Yes '  ;  so ,  very soon the king had watered and tethered his horse ,  and ,  after a supper of bread and parched peas ,  lay down in the cave ,  with the hound at his feet ,  and tried to go to sleep . </s>  But instead of sleeping he only lay awake and thought of the hermit ' s prophecy ;  and the more he thought of it the angrier he felt ,  until he gnashed his teeth and declared that it should never ,  never come true . </s>  Morning came ,  and the king got up ,  pale and sulky ,  and ,  after learning from the hermit which path to take ,  was soon mounted and found his way home without much difficulty . </s>  Directly he reached his palace he wrote a letter to the king of the land of the north ,  begging him ,  as a favour ,  to sell him his slave girl Puruna and her son ,  and saying that ,  if he consented ,  he would send a messenger to receive them at the river which divided the kingdoms . </s>  For five days he awaited the reply ,  and hardly slept or ate ,  but was as cross as could be all the time . </s>  On the fifth day his messenger returned with a letter to say that the king of the land of the north would not sell ,  but he would give ,  the king the slave girl and her son . </s>  The king was overjoyed . He sent for his Grand Wazeer and told him that he was going on one of his lonely expeditions ,  and that the Wazeer must invent some excuse to account for his absence . </s>  Next he disguised himself as an ordinary messenger ,  mounted a swift camel ,  and sped away to the place where the slave girl was to be handed over to him . </s>  When he got there he gave the messengers who brought her a letter of thanks and a handsome present for their master and rewards for themselves ;  and then without delay he took the poor woman and her tiny baby-boy up on to his camel and rode off to a wild desert . </s>  After riding for a day and a night ,  almost without stopping ,  he came to a great cave where he made the woman dismount ,  and ,  taking her and the baby into the cave ,  he drew his sword and with one blow chopped her head off .

'  asked he ,  pausing and looking round . </s>  And a man replied ,  in a faltering voice ,  that each year a beautiful girl was chosen by lot to be offered up to a dreadful fiery dragon ,  who had a mother even worse than himself ,  and this year the lot had fallen on their peerless princess . </s>  ' But where IS the princess ?  '  said the young man once more ,  and again the man answered him :   ' She is standing under a tree ,  a mile away ,  waiting for the dragon . </s>  '  This time the Knight of the Fish did not stop to hear more ,  but ran off as fast as he could ,  and found the princess bathed in tears ,  and trembling from head to foot . </s>  She turned as she heard the sound of his sword ,  and removed her handkerchief from his eyes . ' Fly ,  '  she cried ;   ' fly while you have yet time ,  before that monster sees you . </s>  '  She said it ,  and she mean it ;  yet ,  when he had turned his back ,  she felt more forsaken than before . </s>  But in reality it was not more than a few minutes before he came back ,  galloping furiously on a horse he had borrowed ,  and carrying a huge mirror across its neck . </s>  ' I am in time ,  then ,  '  he cried ,  dismounting very carefully ,  and placing the mirror against the trunk of a tree . ' Give me your veil ,  '  he said hastily to the princess . </s>  And when she had unwound it from her head he covered the mirror with it . </s>  ' The moment the dragon comes near you ,  you must tear off the veil ,  '  cried he ;   ' and be sure you hide behind the mirror .

Then they found their tongues ,  and exclaimed together :   ' Oh ,  yes ,  yes ,  my lord !  we will do everything you tell us . </s>  How could we be so ungrateful as to disobey you ,  when you are so kind ?

'   ' No ,  never ,  '  replied the man . </s>  ' It is no affair of ours ,  '  and the conversation dropped once more ,  but as time went on ,  the woman spoke less and less ,  and seemed so wretched that her husband grew quite frightened about her . </s>  As to her food ,  she refused one thing after another . ' My dear wife ,  '  said the man at last ,   ' you really must eat something . </s>  What in the world is the matter with you ?  If you go on like this you will die . </s>  '   ' I would rather die than not know what is in that tureen ,  '  she burst forth so violently that the husband was quite startled . </s>  ' Is that it ?  '  cried he ;   ' are you making yourself miserable because of that ?  Why ,  you know we should be turned out of the palace ,  and sent away to starve . </s>  '   ' Oh no ,  we should not . The king is too good-natured . </s>  Of course he did not mean a little thing like this !  Besides ,  there is no need to lift the lid off altogether . Just raise one corner so that I may peep . </s>  We are quite alone :  nobody will ever know . </s>  '  The man hesitated :  it did seem a  ' little thing ,  '  and if it was to make his wife contented and happy it was well worth the risk . </s>  So he took hold of the handle of the cover and raised it very slowly and carefully ,  while the woman stooped down to peep . </s>  Suddenly she startled back with a scream ,  for a small mouse had sprung from the inside of the tureen ,  and had nearly hit her in the eye . </s>  Round and round the room it ran ,  round and round they both ran after it ,  knocking down chairs and vases in their efforts to catch the mouse and put it back in the tureen . </s>  In the middle of all the noise the door opened ,  and the mouse ran out between the feet of the king . </s>  In one instant both the man and his wife were hiding under the table ,  and to all appearance the room was empty .

' Mother ,  you have often declared that I was too stupid to catch a wolf by the tail . </s>  Now see ,  '  he cried triumphantly . ' Well ,  well ,  wonders will never cease ,  '  answered the good woman ,  who took care to keep at a safe distance . </s>  ' But as you really have got him ,  let us see if we ca not put him to some use . </s>  Fetch the skin of the ram which died last week out of the chest ,  and we will sew the wolf up in it . </s>  He will make a splendid ram ,  and to-morrow we will drive him to the fair and sell him . </s>  '  Very likely the wolf ,  who was cunning and clever ,  may have understood what she said ,  but he thought it best to give no sign ,  and suffered the skin to be sewn upon him . </s>  ' I can always get away if I choose ,  '  thought he ,   ' it is better not to be in a hurry ;  '  so he remained quite still while the skin was drawn over his head ,  which made him very hot and uncomfortable ,  and resisted the temptation to snap off the fingers or noses that were so close to his mouth . </s>  The fair was at its height next day when Toueno-Boueno arrived with his wolf in ram ' s clothing . All the farmers crowded round him ,  each offering a higher price than the last . </s>  Never had they beheld such a beautiful beast ,  said they ,  and at last ,  after much bargaining ,  he was handed over to three brothers for a good sum of money . </s>  It happened that these three brothers owned large flocks of sheep ,  though none so large and fine as the one they had just bought . </s>  ' My flock is the nearest ,  '  observed the eldest brother ;   ' we will leave him in the fold for the night ,  and to-morrow we will decide which pastures will be best for him . </s>  '  And the wolf grinned as he listened ,  and held up his head a little higher than before . </s>  Early next morning the young farmer began to go his rounds ,  and the sheep-fold was the first place he visited . </s>  To his horror ,  the sheep were all stretched out dead before him ,  except one ,  which the wolf had eaten ,  bones and all . Instantly the truth flashed upon him . </s>  It was no ram that lay curled up in the corner pretending to be asleep  ( for in reality he could bend back and turn his head as much as he liked )  ,  but a wolf who was watching him out of the corner of his eye ,  and might spring upon him at any moment . </s>  So the farmer took no notice ,  and only thought that here was a fine chance of revenging himself on his next brother for a trick which he had played ,  and merely told him that the ram would not eat the grass in that field ,  and it might be well to drive him to the pasture by the river ,  where his own flock was feeding . </s>  The second brother eagerly swallowed the bait ,  and that evening the wolf was driven down to the field where the young man kept the sheep which had been left him by his father . </s>  By the next morning they also were all dead ,  but the second brother likewise held his peace ,  and allowed the sheep which belonged to the youngest to share the fate of the other two . </s>  Then they met and confessed to each other their disasters ,  and resolved to take the animal as fast as possible back to Toueno-Boueno ,  who should get a sound thrashing . </s>  Antoine was sitting on a plum tree belonging to a neighbour ,  eating the ripe fruit ,  when he saw the three young farmers coming towards him . </s>  Swinging himself down ,  he flew home to the hut ,  crying breathlessly ,   ' Mother ,  mother ,  the farmers are close by with the wolf . </s>  They have found out all about it ,  and will certainly kill me ,  and perhaps you too . But if you do as I tell you ,  I may be able to save us both . </s>  Lie down on the floor ,  and pretend to be dead ,  and be sure not to speak ,  whatever happens . </s>  Thus when the three brothers ,  each armed with a whip ,  entered the hut a few seconds later ,  they found a woman extended on the floor ,  and Toueno kneeling at her side ,  whistling loudly into her ears . </s>  ' What are you doing now ,  you rascal ?  '  asked the eldest . </s>  ' What am I doing ?  Oh ,  my poor friends ,  I am the most miserable creature in the world !  I have lost the best of mothers ,  and I do not know what will become of me ,  '  and he hid his face in his hands and sobbed again . </s>  ' But what are you whistling like that for ?  '   ' Well ,  it is the only chance . </s>  This whistle has been known to bring the dead back to life ,  and I hoped --  '  here he buried his face in his hands again ,  but peeping between his fingers he saw that the brother had opened their six eyes as wide as saucers . </s>  ' Look !  '  he suddenly exclaimed with a cry ,   ' Look !  I am sure I felt her body move !  And now her nostrils are twitching . </s>  Ah !  the whistle has not lost its power after all ,  '  and stooping down ,  Toueno whistled more loudly than before ,  so that the old woman ' s feet and hands showed signs of life ,  and she soon was able to life her head . </s>  The farmers were so astonished at her restoration ,  that it was some time before they could speak . At length the eldest turned to the boy and said :   ' Now listen to me . </s>  There is no manner of doubt that you are a young villain . </s>  You sold us a ram knowing full well that it was a wolf ,  and we came here to-day to pay you out for it . </s>  But if you will give us that whistle ,  we will pardon what you have done ,  and will leave you alone . </s>  '   ' It is my only treasure ,  and I set great store by it ,  '  answered the boy ,  pretending to hesitate .

This does not seem much ,  but it sufficed Maie for a herb plot . </s>  All good things go in threes ,  so Matte and his wife fished for salmon in spring ,  for herring in summer ,  and for cod in winter . </s>  When on Saturdays the weather was fine and the wind favourable ,  they sailed to the nearest town ,  sold their fish ,  and went to church on Sunday . </s>  But it often happened that for weeks at a time they were quite alone on the rock Ahtola ,  and had nothing to look at except their little yellow-brown dog ,  which bore the grand name of Prince ,  their grass tufts ,  their bushes and blooms ,  the sea bays and fish ,  a stormy sky and the blue ,  white-crested waves . </s>  For the rock lay far away from the land ,  and there were no green islets or human habitations for miles round ,  only here and there appeared a rock of the same red stone as Ahtola ,  besprinkled day and night with the ocean spray . </s>  Matte and Maie were industrious ,  hard-working folk ,  happy and contented in their poor hut ,  and they thought themselves rich when they were able to salt as many casks of fish as they required for winter and yet have some left over with which to buy tobacco for the old man ,  and a pound or two of coffee for his wife ,  with plenty of burned corn and chicory in it to give it a flavour . </s>  Besides that ,  they had bread ,  butter ,  fish ,  a beer cask ,  and a buttermilk jar ;  what more did they require ?  All would have gone well had not Maie been possessed with a secret longing which never let her rest ;  and this was ,  how she could manage to become the owner of a cow . </s>  ' What would you do with a cow ?  '  asked Matte . </s>  ' She could not swim so far ,  and our boat is not large enough to bring her over here ;  and even if we had her ,  we have nothing to feed her on . </s>  '   ' We have four alder bushes and sixteen tufts of grass ,  '  rejoined Maie . ' Yes ,  of course ,  '  laughed Matte ,   ' and we have also three plants of garlic . </s>  Garlic would be fine feeding for her . '   ' Every cow likes salt herring ,  '  rejoined his wife . ' Even Prince is fond of fish . '   ' That may be ,  '  said her husband . </s>  ' Methinks she would soon be a dear cow if we had to feed her on salt herring . All very well for Prince ,  who fights with the gulls over the last morsel . </s>  Put the cow out of your head ,  mother ,  we are very well off as we are . '  Maie sighed . </s>  She knew well that her husband was right ,  but she could not give up the idea of a cow . </s>  The buttermilk no longer tasted as good as usual in the coffee ;  she thought of sweet cream and fresh butter ,  and of how there was nothing in the world to be compared with them . </s>  One day as Matte and his wife were cleaning herring on the shore they heard Prince barking ,  and soon there appeared a gaily painted boat with three young men in it ,  steering towards the rock . </s>  They were students ,  on a boating excursion ,  and wanted to get something to eat . ' Bring us a junket ,  good mother ,  '  cried they to Maie . </s>  ' Ah !  if only I had such a thing !  '  sighed Maie . ' A can of fresh milk ,  then ,  '  said the students ;   ' but it must not be skim . </s>  '   ' Yes ,  if only I had it !  '  sighed the old woman ,  still more deeply . ' What !  have not you got a cow ?  '  Maie was silent . </s>  This question so struck her to the heart that she could not reply . </s>  ' We have no cow ,  '  Matte answered ;   ' but we have good smoked herring ,  and can cook them in a couple of hours . </s>  '   ' All right ,  then ,  that will do ,  '  said the students ,  as they flung themselves down on the rock ,  while fifty silvery-white herring were turning on the spit in front of the fire . </s>  ' What ' s the name of this little stone in the middle of the ocean ?  '  asked one of them . ' Ahtola ,  '  answered the old man . </s>  ' Well ,  you should want for nothing when you live in the Sea King ' s dominion . '  Matte did not understand . </s>  He had never read Kalevala and knew nothing of the sea gods of old ,  but the students proceeded to explain to him . </s>  [ FN2 :  Kalevala is a collection of old Finnish songs about gods and heroes . </s>  ]   ' Ahti ,  '  said they ,   ' is a mighty king who lives in his dominion of Ahtola ,  and has a rock at the bottom of the sea ,  and possesses besides a treasury of good things . </s>  He rules over all fish and animals of the deep ;  he has the finest cows and the swiftest horses that ever chewed grass at the bottom of the ocean . </s>  He who stands well with Ahti is soon a rich man ,  but one must beware in dealing with him ,  for he is very changeful and touchy . </s>  Even a little stone thrown into the water might offend him ,  and then as he takes back his gift ,  he stirs up the sea into a storm and drags the sailors down into the depths . </s>  Ahti owns also the fairest maidens ,  who bear the train of his queen Wellamos ,  and at the sound of music they comb their long ,  flowing locks ,  which glisten in the water . </s>  '   ' Oh !  '  cried Matte ,   ' have your worships really seen all that ?  '   ' We have as good as seen it ,  '  said the students . </s>  ' It is all printed in a book ,  and everything printed is true . '   ' I am not so sure of that ,  '  said Matte ,  as he shook his head . </s>  But the herring were now ready ,  and the students ate enough for six ,  and gave Prince some cold meat which they happened to have in the boat . </s>  Prince sat on his hind legs with delight and mewed like a pussy cat . </s>  When all was finished ,  the students handed Matte a shining silver coin ,  and allowed him to fill his pipe with a special kind of tobacco . </s>  They then thanked him for his kind hospitality and went on their journey ,  much regretted by Prince ,  who sat with a woeful expression and whined on the shore as long as he could see a flip of the boat ' s white sail in the distance . </s>  Maie had never uttered a word ,  but thought the more . She had good ears ,  and had laid to heart the story about Ahti . </s>  ' How delightful ,  '  thought she to herself ,   ' to possess a fairy cow !  How delicious every morning and evening to draw milk from it ,  and yet have no trouble about the feeding ,  and to keep a shelf near the window for dishes of milk and junkets !  But this will never be my luck .

'  asked he . ' To Kerglas ?  are you really going to Kerglas ?  '  cried the woman ,  turning pale . </s>  ' Yes ;  and in order to get there I have come from a country so far off that it has taken me three months '  hard riding to travel as far as this . </s>  '   ' And why do you want to go to Kerglas ?  '  said she . ' I am seeking the basin of gold and the lance of diamonds which are in the castle ,  '  he answered . </s>  Then Peronnik looked up . ' The basin and the lance are very costly things ,  '  he said suddenly . </s>  ' More costly and precious than all the crowns in the world ,  '  replied the stranger ,   ' for not only will the basin furnish you with the best food that you can dream of ,  but if you drink of it ,  it will cure you of any illness however dangerous ,  and will even bring the dead back to life ,  if it touches their mouths . </s>  As to the diamond lance ,  that will cut through any stone or metal . '   ' And to whom do these wonders belong ?  '  asked Peronnik in amazement . </s>  ' To a magician named Rogear who lives in the castle ,  '  answered the woman . ' Every day he passes along here ,  mounted on a black mare ,  with a colt thirteen months old trotting behind . </s>  But no one dares to attack him ,  as he always carries his lance . </s>  '   ' That is true ,  '  said the knight ,   ' but there is a spell laid upon him which forbids his using it within the castle of Kerglas . </s>  The moment he enters ,  the basin and lance are put away in a dark cellar which no key but one can open .

'  and Peronnik ,  though he loved his liberty and hated work ,  recollected the good food he had eaten ,  and agreed to stop . </s>  At sunrise he collected his herd carefully and led them to the rich pasture which lay along the borders of the forest ,  cutting himself a hazel wand with which to keep them in order . </s>  His task was not quite so easy as it looked ,  for the cows had a way of straying into the wood ,  and by the time he had brought one back another was off . </s>  He had gone some distance into the trees ,  after a naughty black cow which gave him more trouble than all the rest ,  when he heard the noise of horse ' s feet ,  and peeping through the leaves he beheld the giant Rogear seated on his mare ,  with the colt trotting behind . </s>  Round the giant ' s neck hung the golden bowl suspended from a chain ,  and in his hand he grasped the diamond lance ,  which gleamed like fire . </s>  But as soon as he was out of sight the idiot sought in vain for traces of the path he had taken . </s>  This happened not only once but many times ,  till Peronnik grew so used to him that he never troubled to hide . </s>  But on each occasion he saw him the desire to possess the bowl and the lance became stronger . </s>  One evening the boy was sitting alone on the edge of the forest ,  when a man with a white beard stopped beside him . </s>  ' Do you want to know the way to Kerglas ?  '  asked the idiot ,  and the man answered  ' I know it well . </s>  '   ' You have been there without being killed by the magician ?  '  cried Peronnik . </s>  ' Oh !  he had nothing to fear from me ,  '  replied the white-bearded man ,   ' I am Rogear ' s elder brother ,  the wizard Bryak .

'  asked Manawyddan . ' It is that thou marry my mother Rhiannon and become lord of the fair lands that I will give her for dowry . </s>  Never did any lady have more wit than she ,  and in her youth none was more lovely ;  even yet she is good to look upon . </s>  '   ' Thou art the best friend that ever a man had ,  '  said Manawyddan . ' Let us go now to seek Rhiannon ,  and the lands where she dwells . </s>  '  Then they set forth ,  but the news of their coming ran swifter still ,  and Rhiannon and Kieva ,  wife of Pryderi ,  made haste to prepare a feast for them . </s>  And Manawyddan found that Pryderi had spoken the truth concerning his mother ,  and asked if she would take him for her husband . </s>  Right gladly did she consent ,  and without delay they were married ,  and rode away to the hunt ,  Rhiannon and Manawyddan ,  Kieva and Pryderi ,  and they would not be parted from each other by night or by day ,  so great was the love between them . </s>  One day ,  when they were returned ,  they were sitting out in a green place ,  and suddenly the crash of thunder struck loudly on their ears ,  and a wall of mist fell between them ,  so that they were hidden one from the other . </s>  Trembling they sat till the darkness fled and the light shone again upon them ,  but in the place where they were wont to see cattle ,  and herds ,  and dwellings ,  they beheld neither house nor beast ,  nor man nor smoke ;  neither was any one remaining in the green place save these four only . </s>  ' Whither have they gone ,  and my host also ?  '  cried Manawyddan ,  and they searched the hall ,  and there was no man ,  and the castle ,  and there was none ,  and in the dwellings that were left was nothing save wild beasts . </s>  For a year these four fed on the meat that Manawyddan and Pryderi killed out hunting ,  and the honey of the bees that sucked the mountain heather . </s>  For a time they desired nothing more ,  but when the next year began they grew weary . </s>  ' We cannot spend our lives thus ,  '  said Manawyddan at last ,   ' let us go into England and learn some trade by which we may live . </s>  '  So they left Wales ,  and went to Hereford ,  and there they made saddles ,  while Manawyddan fashioned blue enamel ornaments to put on their trappings . </s>  And so greatly did the townsfolk love these saddles ,  that no others were bought throughout the whole of Hereford ,  till the saddlers banded together and resolved to slay Manawyddan and his companions . </s>  When Pryderi heard of it ,  he was very wroth ,  and wished to stay and fight . But the counsels of Manawyddan prevailed ,  and they moved by night to another city . </s>  ' What craft shall we follow ?  '  asked Pryderi . ' We will make shields ,  '  answered Manawyddan . ' But do we know anything of that craft ?  '  answered Pryderi . </s>  ' We will try it ,  '  said Manawyddan ,  and they began to make shields ,  and fashioned them after the shape of the shields they had seen ;  and these likewise they enamelled . </s>  And so greatly did they prosper that no man in the town bought a shield except they had made it ,  till at length the shield-makers banded together as the saddlers had done ,  and resolved to slay them . </s>  But of this they had warning ,  and by night betook themselves to another town . </s>  ' Let us take to making shoes ,  '  said Manawyddan ,   ' for there are not any among the shoemakers bold enough to fight us . </s>  '   ' I know nothing of making shoes ,  '  answered Pryderi ,  who in truth despised so peaceful a craft . ' But I know ,  '  replied Manawyddan ,   ' and I will teach thee to stitch . </s>  We will buy the leather ready dressed ,  and will make the shoes from it . </s>  Then straightway he sought the town for the best leather ,  and for a goldsmith to fashion the clasps ,  and he himself watched till it was done ,  so that he might learn for himself . </s>  Soon he became known as  ' The Maker of Gold Shoes ,  '  and prospered so greatly ,  that as long as one could be bought from him not a shoe was purchased from the shoemakers of the town . </s>  And the craftsmen were wroth ,  and banded together to slay them . ' Pryderi ,  '  said Manawyddan ,  when he had received news of it ,   ' we will not remain in England any longer . </s>  Let us set forth to Dyved . '  So they journeyed until they came to their lands at Narberth . There they gathered their dogs round them ,  and hunted for a year as before . </s>  After that a strange thing happened . One morning Pryderi and Manawyddan rose up to hunt ,  and loosened their dogs ,  which ran before them ,  till they came to a small bush . </s>  At the bush ,  the dogs shrank away as if frightened ,  and returned to their masters ,  their hair brisling on their backs . </s>  ' We must see what is in that bush ,  '  said Pryderi ,  and what was in it was a boar ,  with a skin as white as the snow on the mountains . </s>  And he came out ,  and made a stand as the dogs rushed on him ,  driven on by the men . </s>  Long he stood at bay ;  then at last he betook himself to flight ,  and fled to a castle which was newly built ,  in a place where no building had ever been known . </s>  Into the castle he ran ,  and the dogs after him ,  and long though their masters looked and listened ,  they neither saw nor heard aught concerning dogs or boar . </s>  ' I will go into the castle and get tidings of the dogs ,  '  said Pryderi at last . </s>  ' Truly ,  '  answered Manawyddan ,   ' thou wouldst do unwisely ,  for whosoever has cast a spell over this land has set this castle here . </s>  '   ' I cannot give up my dogs ,  '  replied Pryderi ,  and to the castle he went . </s>  But within was neither man nor beast ;  neither boar nor dogs ,  but only a fountain with marble round it ,  and on the edge a golden bowl ,  richly wrought ,  which pleased Pryderi greatly . </s>  In a moment he forgot about his dogs ,  and went up to the bowl and took hold of it ,  and his hands stuck to the bowl ,  and his feet to the marble slab ,  and despair took possession of him . </s>  Till the close of day Manawyddan waited for him ,  and when the sun was fast sinking ,  he went home ,  thinking that he had strayed far . </s>  ' Where are thy friend and thy dogs ?  '  said Rhiannon ,  and he told her what had befallen Pryderi . </s>  ' A good friend hast thou lost ,  '  answered Rhiannon ,  and she went up to the castle and through the gate ,  which was open . </s>  There ,  in the centre of the courtyard ,  she beheld Pryderi standing ,  and hastened towards him . </s>  ' What dost thou here ?  '  she asked ,  laying her hand on the bowl ,  and as she spoke she too stuck fast ,  and was not able to utter a word . </s>  Then thunder was heard and a veil of darkness descended upon them ,  and the castle vanished and they with it . </s>  When Kieva ,  the wife of Pryderi ,  found that neither her husband nor his mother returned to her ,  she was in such sorrow that she cared not whether she lived or died . </s>  Manawyddan was grieved also in his heart ,  and said to her :   ' It is not fitting that we should stay here ,  for he have lost our dogs and cannot get food . </s>  Let us go into England -- it is easier for us to live there . '  So they set forth . ' What craft wilt thou follow ?  '  asked Kieva as they went along . </s>  ' I shall make shoes as once I did ,  '  replied he ;  and he got all the finest leather in the town and caused gilded clasps to be made for the shoes ,  till everyone flocked to buy ,  and all the shoemakers in the town were idle and banded together in anger to kill him .

'  The rest all burst out laughing ,  and the eldest pointed out that a princess ought never to lower herself by looking at a garden boy . </s>  Now Michael knew quite well what had happened to all the princes ,  but notwithstanding ,  the beautiful eyes of the Princess Lina inspired him with a violent longing to try his fate . </s>  Unhappily he did not dare to come forward ,  being afraid that he should only be jeered at ,  or even turned away from the castle on account of his impudence . </s>  Nevertheless ,  the Star Gazer had another dream . </s>  The lady in the golden dress appeared to him once more ,  holding in one hand two young laurel trees ,  a cherry laurel and a rose laurel ,  and in the other hand a little golden rake ,  a little golden bucket ,  and a silken towel . </s>  She thus addressed him :   ' Plant these two laurels in two large pots ,  rake them over with the rake ,  water them with the bucket ,  and wipe them with the towel . </s>  When they have grown as tall as a girl of fifteen ,  say to each of them ,   '  ' My beautiful laurel ,  with the golden rake I have raked you ,  with the golden bucket I have watered you ,  with the silken towel I have wiped you . </s>  '  '  Then after that ask anything you choose ,  and the laurels will give it to you . </s>  '  Michael thanked the lady in the golden dress ,  and when he woke he found the two laurel bushes beside him .

'  Then there instantly appeared on the laurel a pretty white flower ,  which Michael gathered and stuck into his button-hole . </s>  That evening ,  when the princesses went upstairs to bed ,  he followed them barefoot ,  so that he might make no noise ,  and hid himself under one of the twelve beds ,  so as not to take up much room . </s>  The princesses began at once to open their wardrobes and boxes . </s>  They took out of them the most magnificent dresses ,  which they put on before their mirrors ,  and when they had finished ,  turned themselves all round to admire their appearances . </s>  Michael could see nothing from his hiding-place ,  but he could hear everything ,  and he listened to the princesses laughing and jumping with pleasure .

 now we are ruined indeed ,  for that was no other than the Fairy Carabosse ,  who has had a grudge against me ever since I was a boy and put sulphur into her porridge one day for fun . </s>  '  Then the Queen began to cry . </s>  ' If I had only known who it was ,  '  she said ,   ' I would have done my best to make friends with her ;  now I suppose all is lost . </s>  '  The King was sorry to have frightened her so much ,  and proposed that they should go and hold a council as to what was best to be done to avert the misfortunes which Carabosse certainly meant to bring upon the little Princess . </s>  So all the counsellors were summoned to the palace ,  and when they had shut every door and window ,  and stuffed up every keyhole that they might not be overheard ,  they talked the affair over ,  and decided that every fairy for a thousand leagues round should be invited to the christening of the Princess ,  and that the time of the ceremony should be kept a profound secret ,  in case the Fairy Carabosse should take it into her head to attend it . </s>  The Queen and her ladies set to work to prepare presents for the fairies who were invited :  for each one a blue velvet cloak ,  a petticoat of apricot satin ,  a pair of high-heeled shoes ,  some sharp needles ,  and a pair of golden scissors . </s>  Of all the fairies the Queen knew ,  only five were able to come on the day appointed ,  but they began immediately to bestow gifts upon the Princess . </s>  One promised that she should be perfectly beautiful ,  the second that she should understand anything -- no matter what -- the first time it was explained to her ,  the third that she should sing like a nightingale ,  the fourth that she should succeed in everything she undertook ,  and the fifth was opening her mouth to speak when a tremendous rumbling was heard in the chimney ,  and Carabosse ,  all covered with soot ,  came rolling down ,  crying :   ' I say that she shall be the unluckiest of the unlucky until she is twenty years old . </s>  '  Then the Queen and all the fairies began to beg and beseech her to think better of it ,  and not be so unkind to the poor little Princess ,  who had never done her any harm . </s>  But the ugly old Fairy only grunted and made no answer . </s>  So the last Fairy ,  who had not yet given her gift ,  tried to mend matters by promising the Princess a long and happy life after the fatal time was over . </s>  At this Carabosse laughed maliciously ,  and climbed away up the chimney ,  leaving them all in great consternation ,  and especially the Queen . </s>  However ,  she entertained the fairies splendidly ,  and gave them beautiful ribbons ,  of which they are very fond ,  in addition to the other presents . </s>  When they were going away the oldest Fairy said that they were of opinion that it would be best to shut the Princess up in some place ,  with her waiting-women ,  so that she might not see anyone else until she was twenty years old . </s>  So the King had a tower built on purpose . </s>  It had no windows ,  so it was lighted with wax candles ,  and the only way into it was by an underground passage ,  which had iron doors only twenty feet apart ,  and guards were posted everywhere . </s>  The Princess had been named Mayblossom ,  because she was as fresh and blooming as Spring itself ,  and she grew up tall and beautiful ,  and everything she did and said was charming . </s>  Every time the King and Queen came to see her they were more delighted with her than before ,  but though she was weary of the tower ,  and often begged them to take her away from it ,  they always refused . </s>  The Princess ' s nurse ,  who had never left her ,  sometimes told her about the world outside the tower ,  and though the Princess had never seen anything for herself ,  yet she always understood exactly ,  thanks to the second Fairy ' s gift . </s>  Often the King said to the Queen :   ' We were cleverer than Carabosse after all .

I have never seen the sun ,  or the stars ,  or a horse ,  or a monkey ,  or a lion ,  except in pictures ,  and though the King and Queen tell me I am to be set free when I am twenty ,  I believe they only say it to keep me amused ,  when they never mean to let me out at all .

The youngest of them was called Dullhead ,  and was sneered and jeered at and snubbed on every possible opportunity . </s>  One day it happened that the eldest son wished to go into the forest to cut wood ,  and before he started his mother gave him a fine rich cake and a bottle of wine ,  so that he might be sure not to suffer from hunger or thirst . </s>  When he reached the forest he met a little old grey man who wished him  ' Good-morning ,  '  and said :   ' Do give me a piece of that cake you have got in your pocket ,  and let me have a draught of your wine -- I am so hungry and thirsty . </s>  '  But this clever son replied :   ' If I give you my cake and wine I shall have none left for myself ;  you just go your own way ;  '  and he left the little man standing there and went further on into the forest . </s>  There he began to cut down a tree ,  but before long he made a false stroke with his axe ,  and cut his own arm so badly that he was obliged to go home and have it bound up . </s>  Then the second son went to the forest ,  and his mother gave him a good cake and a bottle of wine as she had to his elder brother . </s>  He too met the little old grey man ,  who begged him for a morsel of cake and a draught of wine . </s>  But the second son spoke most sensibly too ,  and said :   ' Whatever I give to you I deprive myself of . </s>  Just go your own way ,  will you ?  '  Not long after his punishment overtook him ,  for no sooner had he struck a couple of blows on a tree with his axe ,  than he cut his leg so badly that he had to be carried home . </s>  So then Dullhead said :   ' Father ,  let me go out and cut wood . '  But his father answered :   ' Both your brothers have injured themselves . </s>  You had better leave it alone ;  you know nothing about it . '  But Dullhead begged so hard to be allowed to go that at last his father said :   ' Very well ,  then -- go . </s>  Perhaps when you have hurt yourself ,  you may learn to know better . </s>  '  His mother only gave him a very plain cake made with water and baked in the cinders ,  and a bottle of sour beer . </s>  When he got to the forest ,  he too met the little grey old man ,  who greeted him and said :   ' Give me a piece of your cake and a draught from your bottle ;  I am so hungry and thirsty . </s>  '  And Dullhead replied :   ' I have only got a cinder-cake and some sour beer ,  but if you care to have that ,  let us sit down and eat . </s>  '  So they sat down ,  and when Dullhead brought out his cake he found it had turned into a fine rich cake ,  and the sour beer into excellent wine . </s>  Then they ate and drank ,  and when they had finished the little man said :   ' Now I will bring you luck ,  because you have a kind heart and are willing to share what you have with others . </s>  There stands an old tree ;  cut it down ,  and amongst its roots you will find something . '  With that the little man took leave . </s>  Then Dullhead fell to at once to hew down the tree ,  and when it fell he found amongst its roots a goose ,  whose feathers were all of pure gold . </s>  He lifted it out ,  carried it off ,  and took it with him to an inn where he meant to spend the night . </s>  Now the landlord of the inn had three daughters ,  and when they saw the goose they were filled with curiosity as to what this wonderful bird could be ,  and each longed to have one of its golden feathers . </s>  The eldest thought to herself :   ' No doubt I shall soon find a good opportunity to pluck out one of its feathers ,  '  and the first time Dullhead happened to leave the room she caught hold of the goose by its wing . </s>  But ,  lo and behold !  her fingers seemed to stick fast to the goose ,  and she could not take her hand away . </s>  Soon after the second daughter came in ,  and thought to pluck a golden feather for herself too ;  but hardly had she touched her sister than she stuck fast as well . </s>  At last the third sister came with the same intentions ,  but the other two cried out :   ' Keep off !  for Heaven ' s sake ,  keep off !  '  The younger sister could not imagine why she was to keep off ,  and thought to herself :   ' If they are both there ,  why should not I be there too ?  '  So she sprang to them ;  but no sooner had she touched one of them than she stuck fast to her . </s>  So they all three had to spend the night with the goose . </s>  Next morning Dullhead tucked the goose under his arm and went off ,  without in the least troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it . </s>  They just had to run after him right or left as best they could . </s>  In the middle of a field they met the parson ,  and when he saw this procession he cried :   ' For shame ,  you bold girls !  What do you mean by running after a young fellow through the fields like that ?  Do you call that proper behaviour ?  '  And with that he caught the youngest girl by the hand to try and draw her away . </s>  But directly he touched her he hung on himself ,  and had to run along with the rest of them . </s>  Not long after the clerk came that way ,  and was much surprised to see the parson following the footsteps of three girls . </s>  ' Why ,  where is your reverence going so fast ?  '  cried he ;   hado not forget there is to be a christening to-day ;  '  and he ran after him ,  caught him by the sleeve ,  and hung on to it himself :  As the five of them trotted along in this fashion one after the other ,  two peasants were coming from their work with their hoes . </s>  On seeing them the parson called out and begged them to come and rescue him and the clerk . </s>  But no sooner did they touch the clerk than they stuck on too ,  and so there were seven of them running after Dullhead and his goose . </s>  After a time they all came to a town where a King reigned whose daughter was so serious and solemn that no one could ever manage to make her laugh . </s>  So the King had decreed that whoever should succeed in making her laugh should marry her . </s>  When Dullhead heard this he marched before the Princess with his goose and its appendages ,  and as soon as she saw these seven people continually running after each other she burst out laughing ,  and could not stop herself . </s>  Then Dullhead claimed her as his bride ,  but the King ,  who did not much fancy him as a son-in-law ,  made all sorts of objections ,  and told him he must first find a man who could drink up a whole cellarful of wine . </s>  Dullhead bethought him of the little grey man ,  who could ,  he felt sure ,  help him ;  so he went off to the forest ,  and on the very spot where he had cut down the tree he saw a man sitting with a most dismal expression of face . </s>  Dullhead asked him what he was taking so much to heart ,  and the man answered :   ' I do not know how I am ever to quench this terrible thirst I am suffering from . </s>  Cold water does not suit me at all . </s>  To be sure I have emptied a whole barrel of wine ,  but what is one drop on a hot stone ?  '   ' I think I can help you ,  '  said Dullhead . </s>  ' Come with me ,  and you shall drink to your heart ' s content . </s>  '  So he took him to the King ' s cellar ,  and the man sat down before the huge casks and drank and drank till he drank up the whole contents of the cellar before the day closed . </s>  Then Dullhead asked once more for his bride ,  but the King felt vexed at the idea of a stupid fellow whom people called  ' Dullhead '  carrying off his daughter ,  and he began to make fresh conditions .
