Ca not you see how ugly Cinderella is !  Ca not you see ?  "   Suddenly she broke off ,  for the fairy had appeared . </s>  " That ' s enough !  "  she exclaimed ,  raising her magic wand . In a flash ,       Cinderella appeared in a splendid dress ,  shining with youth and beauty . </s>  Her      stepmother and stepsisters gaped at her in amazement ,  and the ministers      said ,    " Come with us ,  fair maiden !

"              Then the mirror would reply :               " Young queen ,  thou are so wondrous fair ,                None can with thee at all compare . </s>  "              Then she would go away quite contented ,  for she knew the magic mirror could speak only the truth . </s>  Years went by ,  and as Snow-white grew up ,  she became day after day more beautiful ,  till she reached the age of seven years ,  and then people began to talk about her ,  and say that she would be more lovely even than the queen herself . </s>  So the proud woman went to her magic looking-glass ,  and asked :               " Mirror ,  mirror on the wall ,              Am I most beautiful of all ?  "              But the mirror answered :               " Queen ,  thou are lovely still to see ,                But Snow-white will be               A thousand times more beautiful than thee . </s>  "              Then the queen was terrified ,  and turned green and yellow with jealousy . </s>  If she had caught sight of Snow-white at that moment ,  she would have been ready to tear her heart out of her body ,  she hated the maiden so fiercely . </s>  And this jealousy and envy grew every day stronger and stronger in her heart ,  like a disease ,  till she had no rest day or night . </s>  At last she sent for a hunter ,  who lived near a forest ,  and said to him ,   " Hunter ,  I want to get rid of that child . </s>  Take her out into the wood ,  and if you bring me some proofs that she is dead ,  I will reward you handsomely . Never let her appear before my eyes again . </s>  "              So the hunter enticed the child into the wood ;  but when he took out his hunting-knife to thrust into Snow-white ' s innocent heart ,  she fell on her knees and wept ,  and said ,   " Ah ,  dear hunter ,  leave me my life ;  I will run away into the wild wood ,  and never ,  never come home any more . </s>  "              She looked so innocent and beautiful as she knelt ,  that the hunter ' s heart was moved with compassion :   " Run away ,  then ,  thou poor child ,  "  he cried ;   " I cannot harm thee . </s>  "              Snow-white thanked him so sweetly ,  and was out of sight in a few moments .

"  they said to each other ,  and were so delighted that they would not awaken her ,  but left her to sleep as long as she liked in the little bed ,  while its owner slept with one of his companions ,  and so the night passed away . </s>  In the morning ,  when Snow-white awoke ,  and saw all the dwarfs ,  she was terribly frightened . But they spoke kindly to her ,  till she lost all fear ,  and they asked her name . </s>  " I am called Snow-white ,  "  she replied . " But how came you to our house ?  "  asked one . </s>

Have we shed the soft light of unwearied love  around his cold heart ,  and with patient tenderness shown him how bright and beautiful  love can make even the darkest lot ?

At last she  decided to alter her demand . </s>  A fourth time she returned ,  consenting  to forego all thoughts of vengeance if the king would order the young  hero to marry her . </s>  The Cid was very willing ,  for he had learned to  love the girl ,  admiring her beauty and spirit . </s>  The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and the king gave  Rodrigo four cities as a marriage portion . </s>  Rodrigo ,  vowing that he  would not be worthy of his wife until he had won five battles ,  after  a pious pilgrimage to the shrine of the patron saint ,  hastened off to  Calahorra ,  a frontier town claimed by two kings—the kings of  Castile and Oregon . </s>  It had been decided that the dispute over the town should be  settled by combat . Rodrigo became the champion of Ferdinand of  Castile . </s>  The other champion ,  Martin Gonzalez ,  began ,  as soon as the  combat opened ,  to taunt the Cid . </s>  " Never again will you mount your favorite steed Babieça ,  "   he said ,   " never will you return to your castle ;  never will you  see your beloved Ximena again . </s>  "  But the Cid was undaunted ,  and had soon laid his enemy low . Great  praise then was given to the Cid—so great that the knights of  Castile were jealous and plotted to kill him . </s>  But the Moorish kings  whom he had captured and released warned him in time to avert the  danger . </s>  Then the Cid aided Ferdinand in defeating the hostile Moors in  Estremadura ,  after a siege of Coimbra lasting seven months . </s>  Several  other victories over his country ' s enemies were added to this ,  and  then Rodrigo returned to his beloved wife . But not for long was he permitted to remain in the quiet of home . </s>  Henry III ,  Emperor of Germany ,  complained to the Pope that King  Ferdinand had refused to acknowledge his superiority . The Pope sent a  message to Ferdinand ,  demanding homage and tribute . </s>  The demand  angered both Ferdinand and the Cid . </s>  " Never yet have we done homage ,  "  cried the Cid ,   " and  shall we now bow to a stranger ?  "  A proud refusal was then sent to the Pope ,  and he ,  knowing of no  better way to settle the dispute ,  bade Henry send a champion to meet  Rodrigo . </s>  The emperor ' s champion was ,  of course ,  defeated ,  and all of  Ferdinand ' s enemies were so awed by the outcome of the fight that  none ever again demanded homage or tribute . </s>  Rodrigo was ,  indeed ,  a  very useful subject .

The king ,  angered by the Cid ' s attitude ,  plotted revenge . </s>  Opportunity came during a war with the Moors ,  and the Cid was  banished upon a slight pretext . " I obey ,  O king ,  "  replied the Cid ,  when he heard the  decree . </s>  " I am more ready to serve you than you are to reward me . I pray that you may never more in battle need the right arm and sword  that so often served your father . </s>  "  Then the Cid rode away ,  through a crowd of weeping people ,  and  camped outside of the city until he could make definite plans . </s>  The  people longed to bring him food or offer him shelter ,  but they feared  the displeasure of the king . </s>  One old man ,  however ,  crept outside of  the city with food ,  declaring that he cared  " not a fig "  for  Alfonso ' s commands . </s>  The Cid needed money ,  and to get it he pledged two locked coffers  to some Jews . The Jews in those days were much despised by the  Christians ,  though usually very wealthy . </s>  The men ,  thinking that the  boxes contained vast treasures ,  when in reality they were filled with  sand ,  advanced the Cid 600 marks of gold . </s>  Then the hero bade farewell  to his wife and children and rode away ,  vowing that he would return ,   covered with glory and carrying with him rich spoils . </s>  Within two weeks '  time the Cid and his little band of followers  had captured two Moorish strongholds and carried off much spoil . The  Cid then prepared a truly royal present and sent it to the king . </s>  Alfonso ,  upon receiving the gift ,  pardoned the Cid ,  and published an  edict permitting all who wished to join in the fight against the  Moors to join Rodrigo and his band . </s>  Toledo ,  thanks to the valor of the Cid ,  soon fell into the hands  of Alfonso ,  but a misunderstanding arose and the king insulted the  Cid . </s>  The latter ,  in great rage ,  left the army and made a sudden raid  on Castile .

  so ,  seeing a smooth ,  sandy beach ,  they drove the ships ashore and  dragged them out of reach of the waves ,  and waited till the storm  should abate . </s>  And the third morning being fair ,  they sailed again and  journeyed prosperously till they came to the very end of the great  Peloponnesian land ,  where Cape Malea looks out upon the southern sea . </s>  But contrary currents baffled them ,  so that they could not round it ,   and the north wind blew so strongly that they must fain drive before  it . </s>  And on the tenth day they came to the land where the lotus  grows—a wondrous fruit ,  of which whosoever eats cares not to see  country or wife or children again . </s>  Now the Lotus eaters ,  for so they  call the people of the land ,  were a kindly folk and gave of the fruit  to some of the sailors ,  not meaning them any harm ,  but thinking it to  be the best that they had to give . </s>  These ,  when they had eaten ,  said  that they would not sail any more over the sea ;  which ,  when the wise  Ulysses heard ,  he bade their comrades bind them and carry them ,  sadly  complaining ,  to the ships . </s>  Then ,  the wind having abated ,  they took to their oars and rowed  for many days till they came to the country where the Cyclopes dwell . </s>  Now ,  a mile or so from the shore there was an island ,  very fair and  fertile ,  but no man dwells there or tills the soil ,  and in the island  a harbor where a ship may be safe from all winds ,  and at the head of  the harbor a stream falling from the rock ,  and whispering alders all  about it . </s>  Into this the ships passed safely and were hauled up on the  beach ,  and the crews slept by them ,  waiting for the morning . </s>  And the  next day they hunted the wild goats ,  of which there was great store  on the island ,  and feasted right merrily on what they caught ,  with  draughts of red wine which they had carried off from the town of the  Ciconians . </s>  But on the morrow ,  Ulysses ,  for he was ever fond of adventure and  would know of every land to which he came what manner of men they  were that dwelt there ,  took one of his twelve ships and bade row to  the land . </s>  There was a great hill sloping to the shore ,  and there rose  up here and there a smoke from the caves where the Cyclopes dwelt  apart ,  holding no converse with each other ,  for they were a rude and  savage folk ,  but ruled each his own household ,  not caring for others . </s>  Now very close to the shore was one of these caves ,  very huge and  deep ,  with laurels round about the mouth ,  and in front a fold with  walls built of rough stone and shaded by tall oaks and pines . </s>  So  Ulysses chose out of the crew the twelve bravest ,  and bade the rest  guard the ship ,  and went to see what manner of dwelling this was and  who abode there . </s>  He had his sword by his side ,  and on his shoulder a  mighty skin of wine ,  sweet smelling and strong ,  with which he might  win the heart of some fierce savage ,  should he chance to meet with  such ,  as indeed his prudent heart forecasted that he might . </s>  So they entered the cave and judged that it was the dwelling of  some rich and skilful shepherd . </s>  For within there were pens for the  young of the sheep and of the goats ,  divided all according to their  age ,  and there were baskets full of cheeses ,  and full milk pails  ranged along the wall . </s>  But the Cyclops himself was away in the  pastures . </s>  Then the companions of Ulysses besought him that he would  depart ,  taking with him ,  if he would ,  a store of cheeses and sundry  of the lambs and of the kids . </s>  But he would not ,  for he wished to see ,   after his wont ,  what manner of host this strange shepherd might be . </s>  And truly he saw it to his cost !  It was evening when the Cyclops came home ,  a mighty giant ,  twenty  feet in height or more . </s>  On his shoulder he bore a vast bundle of pine  logs for his fire ,  and threw them down outside the cave with a great  crash ,  and drove the flocks within ,  and closed the entrance with a  huge rock ,  which twenty wagons and more could not bear . </s>  Then he  milked the ewes and all the she-goats ,  and half of the milk he  curdled for cheese and half he set ready for himself when he should  sup . </s>  Next he kindled a fire with the pine logs ,  and the flame lighted  up all the cave ,  showing Ulysses and his comrades . </s>  " Who are ye ?  "  cried Polyphemus ,  for that was the giant ' s  name . </s>  " Are ye traders or ,  haply ,  pirates ?  "  For in those days it was not counted shame to be called a pirate . </s>  Ulysses shuddered at the dreadful voice and shape ,  but bore him  bravely ,  and answered ,   " We are no pirates ,  mighty sir ,  but  Greeks ,  sailing back from Troy ,  and subjects of the great King  Agamemnon ,  whose fame is spread from one end of heaven to the other . </s>  And we are come to beg hospitality of thee in the name of Zeus ,  who  rewards or punishes hosts and guests according as they be faithful  the one to the other ,  or no . </s>  "   " Nay ,  "  said the giant ,   " it is but idle talk to tell  me of Zeus and the other gods . </s>  We Cyclopes take no account of gods ,   holding ourselves to be much better and stronger than they . </s>  But come ,   tell me where have you left your ship ?  "  But Ulysses saw his thought when he asked about the ship ,  how he  was minded to break it and take from them all hope of flight . </s>  Therefore he answered him craftily :   " Ship have we none ,  for that which was ours King Poseidon  brake ,  driving it on a jutting rock on this coast ,  and we whom thou  seest are all that are escaped from the waves . </s>  "  Polyphemus answered nothing ,  but without more ado caught up two of  the men ,  as a man might catch up the whelps of a dog ,  and dashed them  on the ground ,  and tore them limb from limb and devoured them ,  with  huge draughts of milk between ,  leaving not a morsel ,  not even the  very bones .

After much wandering Œdipus was finally cast into prison . </s>  Then  the two sons took possession of the kingdom ,  making agreement between  themselves that each should reign for the space of one year . </s>  And the  elder of the two ,  whose name was Eteocles ,  first had the kingdom ;  but  when his year was come to an end ,  he would not abide by his promise ,   but kept that which he should have given up ,  and drove out his  younger brother from the city . </s>  Then the younger ,  whose name was  Polynices ,  fled to Argos ,  to King Adrastus . </s>  And after a while he  married the daughter of the king ,  who made a covenant with him that  he would bring him back with a high hand to Thebes and set him on the  throne of his father . </s>  Then the king sent messengers to certain of the  princes of Greece ,  entreating that they would help in this matter . </s>  And of these some would not ,  but others hearkened to his words ,  so  that a great army was gathered together and followed the king and  Polynices to make war against Thebes . </s>  So they came and pitched their  camp over against the city .

So they drew their swords and came yet closer together . </s>  But Eteocles  used a device which he had learnt in the land of Thessaly ;  for he  drew his left foot back ,  as if he would have ceased from the battle ,   and then of a sudden moved the right forward ;  and so smiting  sideways ,  drove his sword right through the body of Polynices . </s>  But  when ,  thinking that he had slain him ,  he set his weapons in the earth  and began to spoil him of his arms ,  the other ,  for he yet breathed a  little ,  laid his hand upon his sword ,  and though he had scarce  strength to smite ,  yet gave the king a mortal blow ,  so that the two  lay dead together on the plain . </s>  And the men of Thebes lifted up the  bodies of the dead and bare them both into the city . </s>  When these two brothers ,  the sons of King Œdipus ,  had fallen each  by the hand of the other ,  the kingdom fell to Creon ,  their uncle . </s>  For  not only was he the next of kin to the dead ,  but also the people held  him in great honor because his son Menœceus had offered himself with  a willing heart that he might deliver his city from captivity . </s>  Now when Creon was come to the throne he made a proclamation about  the two princes ,  commanding that they should bury Eteocles with all  honor ,  seeing that he died as beseemed a good man and a brave ,  doing  battle for his country ,  that it should not be delivered into the  hands of the enemy ;  but as for Polynices ,  he bade them leave his body  to be devoured by the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field ,   because he had joined himself to the enemy and would have beaten down  the walls of the city and burned the temples of the gods with fire  and led the people captive . </s>  Also he commanded that if any man should  break this decree he should suffer death by stoning . </s>  Now Antigone ,  who was sister to the two princes ,  heard that the  decree had gone forth ,  and chancing to meet her sister Ismené before  the gates of the palace ,  spake to her ,  saying :   " O my sister ,  hast thou heard this decree that the king hath  put forth concerning our brethren that are dead ?

Conn the Hundred Fighter ,  Ard-Ri '  of Ireland ,  was in the lowest spirits that can be imagined ,  for his wife was dead . </s>  He had been Ard-Ri for nine years ,  and during his term the corn used to be reaped three times in each year ,  and there was full and plenty of everything . </s>  There are few kings who can boast of more kingly results than he can ,  but there was sore trouble in store for him . </s>  He had been married to Eithne ,  the daughter of Brisland Binn ,  King of Norway ,  and ,  next to his subjects ,  he loved his wife more than all that was lovable in the world . </s>  But the term of man and woman ,  of king or queen ,  is set in the stars ,  and there is no escaping Doom for any one ;  so ,  when her time came ,  Eithne died . </s>  Now there were three great burying-places in Ireland—the Brugh of the Boyne in Ulster ,  over which Angus Og is chief and god ;  the Shi '  mound of Cruachan Ahi ,  where Ethal Anbual presides over the underworld of Connacht ,  and Tailltin ,  in Royal Meath . </s>  It was in this last ,  the sacred place of his own lordship ,  that Conn laid his wife to rest . Her funeral games were played during nine days . </s>  Her keen was sung by poets and harpers ,  and a cairn ten acres wide was heaved over her clay . </s>  Then the keening ceased and the games drew to an end ;  the princes of the Five Prov-inces returned by horse or by chariot to their own places ;  the concourse of mourners melted away ,  and there was nothing left by the great cairn but the sun that dozed upon it in the daytime ,  the heavy clouds that brooded on it in the night ,  and the desolate ,  memoried king . </s>  For the dead queen had been so lovely that Conn could not forget her ;  she had been so kind at every moment that he could not but miss her at every moment ;  but it was in the Council Chamber and the Judgement Hall that he most pondered her memory . </s>  For she had also been wise ,  and lack-ing her guidance ,  all grave affairs seemed graver ,  shadowing each day and going with him to the pillow at night . </s>  The trouble of the king becomes the trouble of the subject ,  for how shall we live if judgement is withheld ,  or if faulty decisions are promulgated ?  Therefore ,  with the sorrow of the king ,  all Ireland was in grief ,  and it was the wish of every person that he should marry again . </s>  Such an idea ,  however ,  did not occur to him ,  for he could not conceive how any woman should fill the place his queen had vacated . </s>  He grew more and more despondent ,  and less and less fitted to cope with affairs of state ,  and one day he instructed his son Art to take the rule during his absence ,  and he set out for Ben Edair . </s>  For a great wish had come upon him to walk beside the sea ;  to listen to the roll and boom of long ,  grey breakers ;  to gaze on an unfruitful ,  desolate wilderness of waters ;  and to forget in those sights all that he could forget ,  and if he could not forget then to remember all that he should remember . </s>  He was thus gazing and brooding when one day he observed a coracle drawing to the shore . A young girl stepped from it and walked to him among black boulders and patches of yellow sand . </s>  Being a king he had authority to ask questions . </s>  Conn asked her ,  therefore ,  all the questions that he could think of ,  for it is not every day that a lady drives from the sea ,  and she wearing a golden-fringed cloak of green silk through which a red satin smock peeped at the openings .

After that ,  the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum . </s>  It conveyed to my soul the idea of REVOLUTION ,  perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a mill-wheel . This only for a brief period ,  for presently I heard no more . </s>  Yet ,  for a while ,  I saw ,  but with how terrible an exaggeration !  I saw the lips of the black-robed judges . </s>  They appeared to me white -- whiter than the sheet upon which I trace these words -- and thin even to grotesqueness ;  thin with the intensity of their expression of firmness ,  of immovable resolution ,  of stern contempt of human torture . </s>  I saw that the decrees of what to me was fate were still issuing from those lips .

How at least shall we distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb ?  But if the impressions of what I have termed the first stage are not at will recalled ,  yet ,  after long interval ,  do they not come unbidden ,  while we marvel whence they come ?

It was not that I feared to look upon things horrible ,  but that I grew aghast lest there should be NOTHING to see . </s>  At length ,  with a wild desperation at heart ,  I quickly unclosed my eyes . My worst thoughts ,  then ,  were confirmed . The blackness of eternal night encompassed me . I struggled for breath . </s>  The intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle me .

This I at once saw could not be . </s>  Victims had been in immediate demand . Moreover my dungeon ,  as well as all the condemned cells at Toledo ,  had stone floors ,  and light was not altogether excluded . </s>  A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart ,  and for a brief period I once more relapsed into insensibility . </s>  Upon recovering ,  I at once started to my feet ,  trembling convulsively in every fibre . I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions . </s>

"    " Had you not observed it before ?  "  his master asked with  kindly malice . </s>  " I had observed but not noticed ,  "  the young man  admitted . </s>  " Further ,  "  said the king ,   " surmise is aroused in us  when we discover a woman far from a house ;  for you will have both  observed and noticed that women are home-dwellers ,  and that a house  without a woman or a woman without a house are imperfect objects ,  and  although they be but half observed ,  they are noticed on the double . </s>  "    " There is no doubting it ,  "  the prince answered from a  knitted and thought-tormented brow . " We shall ask this woman for information about herself ,  "   said the king decidedly . </s>  " Let us do so ,  "  his ward agreed   " The king ' s majesty uses the words  ' we '  and  ' us '  when  referring to the king ' s majesty ,  "  said Dermod ,   " but princes  who do not yet rule territories must use another form of speech when  referring to themselves . </s>  "    " I am very thoughtless ,  "  said Crimthann humbly . The king kissed him on both cheeks . </s>  " Indeed ,  my dear heart and my son ,  we are not scolding you ,   but you must try not to look so terribly thoughtful when you think . </s>  It is part of the art of a ruler .

"  cried Crimthann admiringly . </s>  " When you are older ,  "  the king counselled him ,   " you  will admire that which is truly admirable ,  for although the driving  is good the lady is better . "   He continued with enthusiasm . </s>  " She is in truth a wonder of the world and an endless delight  to the eye . </s>  "   She was all that and more ,  and ,  as she took the horses through the  river and lifted them up the bank ,  her flying hair and parted lips  and all the young strength and grace of her body went into the king ' s  eye and could not easily come out again . </s>  Nevertheless ,  it was upon his ward that the lady ' s gaze rested ,   and if the king could scarcely look away from her ,  she could ,  but  only with an equal effort ,  look away from Crimthann . </s>  " Halt there !

"   But the lady stared as royally on the High King as the High King  did on her ,  and ,  whatever it was he saw in those lovely eyes ,  the  king did not insist . </s>  He drew Crimthann apart ,  for he withheld no instruction from that  lad . </s>  " My heart ,  "  he said ,   " we must always try to act  wisely ,  and we should only insist on receiving answers to questions  in which we are personally concerned . </s>  "   Crimthann imbibed all the justice of that remark . " Thus I do not really require to know this lady ' s name ,  nor  do I care from what direction she comes . </s>  "    " You do not ?  "  Crimthann asked . </s>  " No ,  but what I do wish to know is ,  Will she marry me ?  "    " By my hand that is a notable question ,  "  his companion  stammered . </s>  " It is a question that must be answered ,  "  the king cried  triumphantly . </s>  " But ,  "  he continued ,   " to learn what  woman she is ,  or where she comes from ,  might bring us torment as well  as information . </s>  Who knows in what adventures the past has engaged  her !  "   And he stared for a profound moment on disturbing ,  sinister  horizons ,  and Crimthann meditated there with him . </s>  " The past is hers ,  "  he concluded ,   " but the future  is ours ,  and we shall only demand that which is pertinent to the  future . "   He returned to the lady . </s>  " We wish you to be our wife ,  "  he said . And he gazed on  her benevolently and firmly and carefully when he said that ,  so that  her regard could not stray otherwhere . </s>  Yet ,  even as he looked ,  a tear  did well into those lovely eyes ,  and behind her brow a thought moved  of the beautiful boy who was looking at her from the king ' s side .

This King Midas was fonder of gold than of anything else in the world . </s>  He valued his royal crown chiefly because it was composed of that precious metal . </s>  If he loved anything better ,  or half so well ,  it was the one little maiden who played so merrily around her father’s footstool . </s>  But the more Midas loved his daughter ,  the more did he desire and seek for wealth . </s>  He thought ,  foolish man !  that the best thing he could possibly do for this dear child would be to bequeath her the immensest pile of yellow ,  glistening coin ,  that had ever been heaped together since the world was made . </s>  Thus ,  he gave all his thoughts and all his time to this one purpose . </s>  If ever he happened to gaze for an instant at the gold-tinted clouds of sunset ,  he wished that they were real gold ,  and that they could be squeezed safely into his strong box . </s>  When little Marygold ran to meet him with a bunch of buttercups and dandelions ,  he used to say ,   " Poh ,  poh ,  child !  If these flowers were as golden as they look ,  they would be worth the plucking !  "  And yet ,  in his earlier days ,  before he was so entirely possessed of this insane desire for riches ,  King Midas had shown a great taste for flowers . </s>  He had planted a garden ,  in which grew the biggest and beautifulest and sweetest roses that any mortal ever saw or smelt . </s>  These roses were still growing in the garden ,  as large ,  as lovely ,  and as fragrant as when Midas used to pass whole hours in gazing at them and inhaling their perfume . </s>  But now ,  if he looked at them at all ,  it was only to calculate how much the garden would be worth if each of the innumerable rose-petals were a thin plate of gold . </s>  And though he once was fond of music  ( in spite of an idle story about his ears ,  which were said to resemble those of an ass )  ,  the only music for poor Midas ,  now ,  was the chink of one coin against another . </s>  At length  ( as people always grow more and more foolish ,  unless they take care to grow wiser and wiser )  ,  Midas had got to be so exceedingly unreasonable ,  that he could scarcely bear to see or touch any object that was not gold . </s>  He made it his custom ,  therefore ,  to pass a large portion of every day in a dark and dreary apartment ,  under ground ,  at the basement of his palace . </s>  It was here that he kept his wealth . To this dismal hole—for it was little better than a dungeon—Midas betook himself ,  whenever he wanted to be particularly happy . </s>  Here ,  after carefully locking the door ,  he would take a bag of gold coin ,  or a gold cup as big as a washbowl ,  or a heavy golden bar ,  or a peck-measure of gold-dust ,  and bring them from the obscure corners of the room into the one bright and narrow sunbeam that fell from the dungeon-like window . </s>  He valued the sunbeam for no other reason but that his treasure would not shine without its help . </s>  And then would he reckon over the coins in the bag ;  toss up the bar ,  and catch it as it came down ;  sift the gold-dust through his fingers ;  look at the funny image of his own face ,  as reflected in the burnished circumference of the cup ;  and whisper to himself ,   " O Midas ,  rich King Midas ,  what a happy man art thou !  "  But it was laughable to see how the image of his face kept grinning at him ,  out of the polished surface of the cup . </s>  It seemed to be aware of his foolish behavior ,  and to have a naughty inclination to make fun of him . </s>  Midas called himself a happy man ,  but felt that he was not yet quite so happy as he might be . </s>  The very tiptop of enjoyment would never be reached ,  unless the whole world were to become his treasure-room ,  and be filled with yellow metal which should be all his own . </s>  Now ,  I need hardly remind such wise little people as you are ,  that in the old ,  old times ,  when King Midas was alive ,  a great many things came to pass ,  which we should consider wonderful if they were to happen in our own day and country . </s>  And ,  on the other hand ,  a great many things take place nowadays ,  which seem not only wonderful to us ,  but at which the people of old times would have stared their eyes out . </s>  On the whole ,  I regard our own times as the strangest of the two ;  but ,  however that may be ,  I must go on with my story . </s>  Midas was enjoying himself in his treasure-room ,  one day ,  as usual ,  when he perceived a shadow fall over the heaps of gold ;  and ,  looking suddenly up ,  what should he behold but the figure of a stranger ,  standing in the bright and narrow sunbeam !  It was a young man ,  with a cheerful and ruddy face . </s>  Whether it was that the imagination of King Midas threw a yellow tinge over everything ,  or whatever the cause might be ,  he could not help fancying that the smile with which the stranger regarded him had a kind of golden radiance in it . </s>  Certainly ,  although his figure intercepted the sunshine ,  there was now a brighter gleam upon all the piled-up treasures than before . </s>  Even the remotest corners had their share of it ,  and were lighted up ,  when the stranger smiled ,  as with tips of flame and sparkles of fire . </s>  As Midas knew that he had carefully turned the key in the lock ,  and that no mortal strength could possibly break into his treasure-room ,  he ,  of course ,  concluded that his visitor must be something more than mortal . </s>  It is no matter about telling you who he was . </s>  In those days ,  when the earth was comparatively a new affair ,  it was supposed to be often the resort of beings endowed with supernatural power ,  and who used to interest themselves in the joys and sorrows of men ,  women ,  and children ,  half playfully and half seriously . </s>  Midas had met such beings before now ,  and was not sorry to meet one of them again . </s>  The stranger’s aspect ,  indeed ,  was so good-humored and kindly ,  if not beneficent ,  that it would have been unreasonable to suspect him of intending any mischief . </s>  It was far more probable that he came to do Midas a favor . </s>  And what could that favor be ,  unless to multiply his heaps of treasure ?  The stranger gazed about the room ;  and when his lustrous smile had glistened upon all the golden objects that were there ,  he turned again to Midas . </s>  " You are a wealthy man ,  friend Midas !  "  he observed . " I doubt whether any other four walls ,  on earth ,  contain so much gold as you have contrived to pile up in this room . </s>  "   " I have done pretty well , —pretty well ,  "  answered Midas ,  in a discontented tone . </s>  " But ,  after all ,  it is but a trifle ,  when you consider that it has taken me my whole life to get it together . </s>  If one could live a thousand years ,  he might have time to grow rich !

These two used to wonder all day long . </s>  They wondered at the beauty of the flowers ;  they wondered at the height and blueness of the sky ;  they wondered at the depth of the bright water ;  they wondered at the goodness and the power of God who made the lovely world . </s>  They used to say to one another ,  sometimes ,  supposing all the children upon earth were to die ,  would the flowers ,  and the water ,  and the sky be sorry ?  They believed they would be sorry . </s>  For ,  said they ,  the buds are the children of the flowers ,  and the little playful streams that gambol down the hill-sides are the children of the water ;  and the smallest bright specks playing at hide and seek in the sky all night ,  must surely be the children of the stars ;  and they would all be grieved to see their playmates ,  the children of men ,  no more . </s>  There was one clear shining star that used to come out in the sky before the rest ,  near the church spire ,  above the graves . </s>  It was larger and more beautiful ,  they thought ,  than all the others ,  and every night they watched for it ,  standing hand in hand at a window . </s>  Whoever saw it first cried out ,   " I see the star !  "  And often they cried out both together ,  knowing so well when it would rise ,  and where . </s>  So they grew to be such friends with it ,  that ,  before lying down in their beds ,  they always looked out once again ,  to bid it good-night ;  and when they were turning round to sleep ,  they used to say ,   " God bless the star !  "  But while she was still very young ,  oh very ,  very young ,  the sister drooped ,  and came to be so weak that she could no longer stand in the window at night ;  and then the child looked sadly out by himself ,  and when he saw the star ,  turned round and said to the patient pale face on the bed ,   " I see the star !  "  and then a smile would come upon the face ,  and a little weak voice used to say ,   " God bless my brother and the star !  "  And so the time came all too soon !  when the child looked out alone ,  and when there was no face on the bed ;  and when there was a little grave among the graves ,  not there before ;  and when the star made long rays down toward him ,  as he saw it through his tears . </s>  Now ,  these rays were so bright ,  and they seemed to make such a shining way from earth to Heaven ,  that when the child went to his solitary bed ,  he dreamed about the star ;  and dreamed that ,  lying where he was ,  he saw a train of people taken up that sparkling road by angels . </s>  And the star ,  opening ,  showed him a great world of light ,  where many more such angels waited to receive them . </s>  All these angels ,  who were waiting ,  turned their beaming eyes upon the people who were carried up into the star ;  and some came out from the long rows in which they stood ,  and fell upon the people ' s necks ,  and kissed them tenderly ,  and went away with them down avenues of light ,  and were so happy in their company ,  that lying in his bed he wept for joy . </s>  But ,  there were many angels who did not go with them ,  and among them one he knew . </s>  The patient face that once had lain upon the bed was glorified and radiant ,  but his heart found out his sister among all the host . </s>  His sister ' s angel lingered near the entrance of the star ,  and said to the leader among those who had brought the people thither :   " Is my brother come ?

"  Again at night he saw the star ,  and all that former company . </s>  Said his sister ' s angel to the leader :   " Is my brother come ?  "  And he said ,   " Thy mother !  "  A mighty cry of joy went forth through all the star ,  because the mother was reunited to her two children . </s>  And he stretched out his arms and cried ,   " O ,  mother ,  sister ,  and brother ,  I am here !  Take me !

"  And the star was shining . </s>  Thus the child came to be an old man ,  and his once smooth face was wrinkled ,  and his steps were slow and feeble ,  and his back was bent . </s>  And one night as he lay upon his bed ,  his children standing round ,  he cried ,  as he had cried so long ago :   " I see the star !  "  They whispered one to another ,   " He is dying . </s>  "  And he said ,   " I am . My age is falling from me like a garment ,  and I move towards the star as a child . </s>  And O ,  my Father ,  now I thank Thee that it has so often opened ,  to receive those dear ones who await me !

Every farmer in the region was reeling from their losses . </s>  Desperate to change his fortunes ,  Peter Harpole decided to try his luck with poultry farming . </s>  Peter did not know much about chickens ,  but selling eggs would be a great source of food ,  and hopefully income for him and his family . </s>  If he was successful at it !  As the sun got closer to rising over the Harpole farm ,  Toby ,  the Harpole ' s new rooster ,  took his place atop a wooden fence next to the barn . </s>  It was Toby ' s first chance to showcase his ability to crow . Peter purchased Toby the night before from the McHenry farm down the road . </s>  The Harpole ' s were desperate for a good crower ,  because the other rooster on their farm had laryngitis . </s>  With the purchase of Toby ,  the Harpole ' s now had a total of two roosters ,  and twelve hens .

"  asked Peter to his wife . </s>  " Are you referring to the biscuits in your stomach ,  or our new cow you forgot to tell me about ?  "   " I did not buy any cow . </s>  "  Peter got up from the table and proceeded to walk out the front door of his home .

Harpole from behind the screen door . </s>  As Peter and his daughters approached the barn ,  Toby was still sitting atop the wooden fence . " Hello ,  Toby . Where ' s the cow at ?  "  asked Peter . Toby did not say anything . </s>  " Toby ,  where did that mooing come from ?  "  asked Peter . Toby started to shake because he still had some moo left in him . </s>  He tried to keep it inside ,  but his body started to twitch as if he had been holding his breathe for over two minutes . His shaking became uncontrollable . </s>  Unable to hold it in any longer ,  Toby let out the loudest MOOOOOOOOOOO ever heard in Brackford County . Annie and Ellie jumped up and down with excitement . </s>  " Daddy ,  we have a cow now ,  "  said Annie . " Yeah ,  listen to him moo ,  Daddy ,  "  said Ellie . Both of the girls laughed hysterically . " We do not have a cow . </s>  What we have got is a rooster with a weird sense of humor . Girls ,  go inside with your Mother .

Get along now . </s>  "   As the girls walked away disappointed ,  Peter looked Toby over and shook his head . " Well ,  let ' s take it from the top ,  "  said Peter . </s>  " What ' s with the mooing ,  Toby ?  "   " Mr . Harpole ,  you seem really nice and I hope that you will have some patience with what I am about to share with you . </s>  "   " All right ,  I am listening ,  "  said Peter . " I will explain the mooing in a minute ,  but first there is something I have to tell you . </s>  Last night ,  I was taken from my home ,  and nobody even asked me if I was okay with it . I had a life at the McHenry farm and was very happy there . </s>  "   " Toby ,  this is your home now . I paid for you . Mr . McHenry was your rightful owner and he had every right to sell you if he wanted . </s>  If it ' s a nice hen you are looking to settle down with they are plenty available on this farm . </s>  In case you have not already met her ,  Hazel ' s the cute brown-and-white colored hen over in the henhouse . </s>  She ' s a little feisty ,  but I think you two would hit it off once you got to know her . </s>  "   " But I already care about somebody else ,  and I miss her terribly ,  "  said Toby in a sad voice . " Toby ,  you are going to have to get used to living here . </s>  This is your home now . Forget that hen over at the McHenry farm ,  and move on with your life . "    " She is not a hen ,  "  said Toby . </s>  " What do you mean ?  "  asked Peter with a puzzled look on his face . Toby broke out in tears and said ,   " My Edna ,  oh how I miss my dear Edna . </s>  "    " All right ,  all right ,  take it easy . Edna ' s very important to you . I get it . That ' s nice . </s>  I am curious though ,  Toby - if Edna is not a hen ,  what is she ?  "    " She ' s a cow ,  Mr . Harpole . Edna is a big ,  beautiful cow . </s>  "   " You are joking ,  right ?  "  asked Peter . " No ,  sir ,  I am not . That ' s why I have been mooing . </s>  I told Edna before I was taken away that I would moo as loud as I could for her . I want her to hear me so she knows I am thinking of her . </s>  "   " Toby ,  the first question I have for you ,  is how did you fall in love with a cow ?   You are a rooster for crying out loud . </s>  "   " Whoever said love was easy ,  Mr . Harpole . "   " Well ,  I will give you that . But Toby ,  Mr . McHenry does not have any other roosters to sell . </s>  I asked him about that last night . He ' s one of the few farmers close by that even has chickens . </s>  Farmers in this region are not looking to sell their roosters right now anyway ,  because they are trying to breed them . If you have not noticed the crops are not doing so well this year . </s>  "   " I realize that Mr . Harpole ,  but what ' s the problem with me mooing anyway ?   Is it really that big a deal ?  "  asked Toby . </s>  " When it ' s coming from a rooster ,  yes ,  Toby it is . Let ' s say word gets out around town that my rooster moos instead of crows . </s>  The local grocers would probably quit buying from me ,  because they think I have defective chickens . "    " This just is not fair ,  Mr . Harpole . </s>  "   " Toby ,  I want you to think about everything we have discussed . </s>  Bright and early tomorrow morning ,  when you start to cackle ,  I will be expecting to hear several loud crows out of you . </s>  "   As Peter walked back toward the house ,  Toby collected his thoughts and pondered what he was going to do . " Excuse me ,  "  said one of the hens to Toby . </s>  " I hope you do not mind ,  but I was listening to your conversation with Mr . Harpole ,  and I would like to offer you some friendly advice . </s>  "   " Sure ,  fire away ,  "  said Toby . " I could use it right now "  . " Well ,  first you have got to understand Mr . </s>  Harpole ' s just trying to make an honest living to support his family ,  "  said the hen . </s>  " And what ' s so wrong with our place anyway ?   I think you would really like it here if you gave it a chance . "   " Let me stop you right there . </s>  I completely understand and appreciate Mr . Harpole ' s situation . I really do . </s>  But what kind of life are we living for ourselves ,  if we just settle for whatever makes everyone else happy ?   This is a great farm ,  and everyone here has been wonderful so far . </s>  This is not about where I live . I am talking about how I live . I am talking about being with the one I care about . Please do not take this personally . </s>  "    " It ' s a little hard not to . </s>  Your wanting to be on a different farm is one thing ,  but wanting to get back to a cow ;  well ,  now every hen on this farm believes you feel you are too good for them . </s>  "   " That is absolutely not true . Have not you ever been in love ?  "   " Yes ,  Toby ,  but it was not with a frog ,  a goat or a tiger . </s>

" Bipper ,  even though you’re a bear try not to be such a bear to be around ,  "  said Bipper’s Momma . </s>  All of Bipper’s brothers and sisters laughed at Momma bear’s comment . " Bipper ,  in order to be rested for spring time we bears need to hibernate during the winter ,  "  said the Momma bear . </s>  " Yes ,  Momma ,  "  replied Bipper . Bipper kept to himself for the rest of the evening while the other bears prepared to settle down for their long winter nap . </s>  Bipper knew once the other bears fell asleep he could leave the den without being noticed . And that’s exactly what Bipper did . </s>  After all the other bears began to snore ,  Bipper quietly sneaked out of the den and into the forest . </s>  At first ,  Bipper was happy with his new found freedom and loved being able to do whatever he wanted . He rolled around in the snow and repeatedly fell to the ground to make snow angels . </s>  But after some time passed ,  Bipper started to feel lonely and missed his family . The berries he was accustomed to eating off the trees were long gone ,  and he found himself growing very hungry . </s>  Bipper had also traveled a great distance ,  and even though he had a powerful sense of smell ,  he was finding it hard to find his way back to the den . </s>  One evening with nothing but the moonlight above ,  and a pesky owl repeatedly asking him who he was ,  Bipper decided it was time to go home for good . </s>  Suddenly out of nowhere ,  a horrible creepy sound could be heard close by . The noise startled Bipper ,  so he looked around to see where it was coming from . </s>  He didn’t see anything !  The horrible creepy sound could be heard again ,  and this time Bipper knew it was getting closer . " Who’s there ?  "  asked Bipper . </s>  " I’m a bear so you better watch out .

Bear . I’m just a little dog . "   " Relax ,  "  said Bipper . </s>  " I’m not going to hurt you . "   	 " Well ,  that’s a relief to hear ,  but aren’t bears meat eaters ?

"    " Yeah ,  I’m curious ,  "  replied Bipper . </s>  " Well ,  I am out here because I am an old dog that nobody loves anymore . "    " Why would you say such a thing ?  "  asked Bipper . </s>  " Well ,  tomorrow is Christmas day and as an early gift for Christmas my owners bought their children a new puppy . </s>  When the kids saw the puppy for the first time it was as if I didn’t even exist anymore ,  "  said the little dog . " I am sure they still love you just the same . </s>  My Momma always says she has no favorites . She says she loves me and my older siblings equally . Your age will never change how much your family loves you ,  "  said Bipper . </s>  The little dog nodded his head and said ,   " You know ,  you’re right . What was I thinking ?  They have loved me my entire life . </s>  I know they don’t love me any less than before . I guess I was just jealous about the puppy . You have great wisdom for being such a young bear . </s>  Listen to your own advice about family and you won’t be so frustrated about being teased . Take it from an old dog ,  being young is a wonderful thing so enjoy it and have fun . </s>  What’s your name by the way ?  "    " Bipper ,  what’s yours ?  "   " Wick’s my name ,  "  said the little dog . </s>  Bipper and Wick shook paws ,  and promised to help one another find their way home . To help ease the burden of such a long trek ,  Bipper and Wick laughed and played in the snow . </s>  Much to Bipper’s surprise ,  however ,  Wick started to bark out Christmas carols along the way . About a dozen rabbits popped their heads out of their holes to see what was going on . </s>  Wick’s singing made every rabbit flap their long ears downward to ease the strain on their eardrums . </s>  Since Wick was still engaged in song ,  one of the rabbits looked over at Bipper and said ,   " What is wrong with that dog ?  Why is it making so much racket ?  "     " Sorry ,  he’s just having a little festive fun by singing some Christmas carols ,  "  said Bipper . </s>  " That’s what you call that huh ,  singing ?  "  asked the rabbit . </s>  Bipper approached the rabbit and said ,   " Look ,  I know this dog can’t sing in tune ,  but please just bear with me . </s>  We’re on our way home and he just wants to spread a little holiday cheer . </s>  "  The rabbit pointed at her hole in the ground and asked Bipper ,   " You hear that ?  "   Bipper leaned over the rabbit’s hole and said ,   " Yeah ,  I hear Christmas music playing . </s>  "   " That’s right ,  "  said the rabbit .

The lightning bounced off my shell for crying out loud !  "   " Well ,  I must admit it was amazing to see ,  but it did bounce off of you ,  Owen . </s>  Why are you so afraid now ?

"  At this a tame  crow and a parrot which were chained to a perch ,  said  " You will never be able  to find the man with the golden hair ;  he is in the depths of the forest ;  if he  had lived in a village you would have found him ,  but as it is we alone can  fetch him ;  unfasten our chains and we will go in search of him . </s>  "  So the Raja  ordered them to be unfastened and gave them a good meal before starting ,  for  they could not carry a bag of provisions with them like a man . </s>  Then the crow  and the parrot mounted into the air and flew away up the river ,  and after long  search they spied the Goala in the jungle resting his cattle under the peepul  tree ;  so they flew down and perched on the peepul tree and consulted how they  could lure him away . </s>  The parrot said that he was afraid to go near the cattle  and proposed that the crow should fly down and carry off the Goala’s flute ,   from where it was lying with his stick and wrapper at the foot of the tree . </s>  So  the crow went flitting from one cow to another till it suddenly pounced on the  flute and carried it off in its beak ;  when the Goala saw this he ran after the  crow to recover his flute and the crow tempted him on by just fluttering from  tree to tree and the Goala kept following ;  and when the crow was tired the  parrot took the flute from him and so between them they drew the Goala on right  to the Raja’s city ,  and they flew into the palace and the Goala followed them  in ,  and they flew to the room in which the princess was and dropped the flute  into the hand of the princess and the Goala followed and the door was shut upon  him . </s>  The Goala asked the princess to give him the flute and she said that she  would give it to him if he promised to marry her and not otherwise . </s>  He asked  how he could marry her all of a sudden when they had never been betrothed ;  but  the princess said  " We have been betrothed for a long time ;  do you remember one  day tying a hair up in a leaf and setting it to float downstream ;  well that  hair has been the go-between which arranged our betrothal . </s>  "  Then the Goala  remembered how the snake had told him that his hair would find him a wife and  he asked to see the hair which the princess had found ,  so she brought it out  and they found that it was like his ,  as long and as bright ;  then he said  " We  belong to each other "  and the princess called for the door to be opened and  brought the Goala to her father and mother and told them that her heart’s  desire was fulfilled and that if they did not allow the wedding to take place  in the palace she would run away with the Goala . </s>  So a day was fixed for the  wedding and invitations were issued and it duly took place . </s>  The Goala soon  became so much in love with his bride that he forgot all about his herd of  cattle which he had left behind ,  without any one to look after them ;  but after  some time he bethought himself of them and he told his bride that he must  return to his cattle ,  whether she came with him or no . </s>  She said that she would  take leave of her parents and go with him ;  then the Raja gave them a farewell  feast and he made over to the Goala half his kingdom ,  and gave him a son’s  share of his elephants and horses and flocks and herds and said to him  " You are  free to do as you like :  you can stay here or go to your own home ;  but if you  elect to stay here ,  I shall never turn you out . </s>  "  The Goala considered and said  that he would live with his father-in-law but that he must anyhow go and see  the cattle which he had abandoned without any one to look after them . </s>  So the  next day he and his wife set off and when they got to the jungle they found  that all the cattle were lying dead . </s>  At this the Goala was filled with grief  and began to weep ;  then he remembered the promise of the snake that he should  be able to restore the dead to life and he resolved to put it to the test . </s>  So he told his  wife that he would give the dead cows medicine and he got some jungle roots as  a blind and held them to the noses of the dead animals and as he did so ,  he  said  " Come to life "  and ,  behold ,  one by one the cows all got up and began  lowing to their calves .

 he asked them what was the  matter and they told him that the cat was always stealing their Raja’s milk and  the Raja had offered a reward of twenty rupees to anyone who would kill it . </s>  Then Lita said to them  " Do not kill the cat ;  catch it alive and give it to me  and I will pay you twenty rupees for it ;  then you can go to the Raja and say  that you have killed it and ask for the reward ;  and if the Raja asks to see the  body tell him that a stranger came and asked for the body ,  for he thought that  a cat which had fed on milk should be good eating and so you gave it to him . </s>  "   The villagers thought that this would be an excellent plan and promised to  bring him the cat alive . </s>  They soon managed to catch it hiding under a heap of  firewood and brought it to Lita and he paid them twenty rupees and then they  went to the Raja and got twenty rupees from him . </s>  Then Lita went  on ,  and by-and-bye came to a village where the villagers were hunting an otter  in a tank ;  they had made a cut in the bank and had let out all the water . </s>  Lita  went to them and asked what they were doing ;  they said that they were hunting  for an otter which had been destroying the Raja’s fish and the Raja had  promised them a reward if they killed it ,  and they had driven it into the tank  and were draining off the water in order to catch it . </s>  Then Lita offered to buy  it of them if they brought it to him alive ;  so when they caught it they brought  it to him and he gave them money for it and continued his journey with the cat  and the otter . </s>  Presently he saw a crowd of men and he went up to them and asked  what they were doing :  and they told him that they were hunting a rat which was  always gnawing the Raja’s pens and papers and the Raja had offered a reward for  it ,  and they had driven it out of the palace ,  but it had taken refuge in a hole  and they were going to dig it out Then Lita offered to buy it from them as he  had bought the other two animals and they dug it out and sold it to him . </s>  He went on and  in the same way found a crowd of men hunting a snake which had bitten many  people :  and he offered to buy it for twenty rupees and when they had chased it  till it was exhausted ,  they caught it alive and sold it to Lita . </s>  As his money  was all spent ,  he then set off homewards ;  and on the way the snake began to  speak and said :   " Lita ,  you have saved my life ;  had you not come by ,  those men  would certainly have had my life ;  come with me to my home ,  where my father and  mother are ,  and I will give you anything you ask for ;  we have great  possessions . </s>  "  But Lita was afraid and said :   " When you get me there you will eat  me ,  or if you don’t ,  your father and mother will . </s>  "  But the snake protested that  it could not be guilty of such ingratitude and at last Lita agreed to accompany  it when he had left the other animals at his home . </s>  This he did and  set off alone with the snake ,  and after some days they reached the snake’s  home . </s>  The snake told Lita to wait outside while he went and apprized his  parents and he told Lita that when he was asked to choose his reward he should  name nothing but the ring which was on the father-snake’s finger ,  for the ring  had this property that if it were placed in a seer of milk and then asked to  produce anything whatever ,  that thing would immediately appear . </s>  Then the snake  went on to his home and when the father and mother saw him they fell on his  neck and kissed him and wept over him saying that they had never expected to  see him again ;  the snake told them how he had gone to the country of men and  how a reward had been set on his head and he had been hunted ,  and how Lita had  bought him from the men who would have killed him . </s>  The father snake asked why  he had not brought Lita to be rewarded and the snake said that he was afraid  that when they saw him they would eat him . </s>  But the father  and mother swore that they could not be guilty of such ingratitude ,  and when he  heard this the snake went and brought in Lita ,  and they entertained him  handsomely for two days ;

 I saved your son from peril and that you will remember all  your lives ,  and if you give me the ring I will honour you for it as long as I  live . </s>  "  Then the father and mother snake consulted together and the mother said   " Give it to him as he asks for it "  so the father snake drew it from his finger  and gave it to Lita and they gave him also some money for his journey back ;

 it shall be my charge  to arrange for making the covered passage ;  I will not let you be put to shame  over it . </s>  "  For Lita had already put the ring to the test :  he had dropped it into  a seer of milk and said  " Let five bharias of parched rice and two bharias of  curds appear "  and immediately the parched rice and curds were before him ;  and  thereupon he had called out  " The snake has worthily rewarded me for saving his  life ;  "  and the cat and the otter and the rat overheard what he said . </s>  So the go-between  was told to arrange for the wedding to take place that very month ,  as Lita’s  birthday fell in the next month ,  which therefore was not suitable for his  wedding . </s>  Then the bride’s family sent him back to say that they were prepared  to send a string of nine knots ;  and the next day the go-between told this to  Lita’s family and they said that they were willing to accept it ;  so the  go-between brought a string of nine knots to signify that the wedding would  take place in nine days . </s>  The days passed by and Lita’s father and brothers  became very anxious because they saw no sign of the covered passage ;  but on the  very night before the wedding ,  Lita took his ring and ordered a covered passage  to be made from the one house to the other with a good path down the middle ;   and the next morning they found it made ;  and the bridegroom’s party passed  along it to the bride’s house and the bride was escorted home along it .

He never listened to any one ,  not even to his mother ,  but had his own way in everything . </s>  One day he went with his mother to bathe in the river . A large boat was riding there at anchor . None of the boatmen were in it . </s>  The prince went into the boat ,  and told his mother to come into it . His mother besought him to get down from the boat ,  as it did not belong to him . </s>  But the prince said ,   " No ,  mother I am not coming down ;  I mean to go on a voyage ,  and if you wish to come with me ,  then delay not but come up at once ,  or I shall be off in a trice . </s>  "  The queen besought the prince to do no such thing ,  but to come down instantly . But the prince gave no heed to what she said ,  and began to take up the anchor . </s>  The queen went up into the boat in great haste ;  and the moment she was on board the boat started ,  and falling into the current passed on swiftly like an arrow . </s>  The boat went on and on till it reached the sea . </s>  After it had gone many furlongs into the open sea ,  the boat came near a whirlpool where the prince saw a great many rubies of monstrous size floating on the waters . </s>  Such large rubies no one had ever seen ,  each being in value equal to the wealth of seven kings . The prince caught hold of half-a-dozen of those rubies ,  and put them on board . </s>  His mother said ,   " Darling ,  do not take up those red balls ;  they must belong to somebody who has been shipwrecked ,  and we may be taken up as thieves . </s>  "  At the repeated entreaties of his mother ,  the prince threw them into the sea ,  keeping only one tied up in his clothes . </s>  The boat then drifted toward the coast ,  and the queen and the prince arrived at a certain port where they landed . </s>  The port where they landed was not a small place ;  it was a large city ,  the capital of a great king . </s>  Not far from the palace ,  the queen and her son hired a hut where they lived . As the prince was yet a boy ,  he was fond of playing at marbles . </s>  When the children of the king came out to play on a lawn before the palace ,  our young prince joined them . </s>  He had no marbles ,  but he played with the ruby which he had in his possession . The ruby was so hard that it broke every taw against which it struck . </s>  The daughter of the king ,  who used to watch the games from a balcony of the palace ,  was astonished to see a brilliant red ball in the hand of the strange lad ,  and wanted to take possession of it . </s>  She told her father that a boy of the street had an uncommonly bright stone in his possession which she must have or else she would starve herself to death . </s>  The king ordered his servants to bring to him the lad with that precious stone . When the boy was brought ,  the king wondered at the largeness and brilliancy of the ruby . </s>  He had never seen anything like it . He doubted whether any king of any country in the world possessed so great a treasure . He asked the lad where he had got it . </s>  The lad replied that he got it from the sea . The king offered a thousand rupees for the ruby ,  and the lad ,  not knowing its value ,  readily parted with it for that sum . </s>  He went with the money to his mother ,  who was not a little frightened ,  thinking that her son had stolen the money from some rich man ' s house . </s>  She became quiet ,  however ,  on being assured that the money was given to him by the king in exchange for the red ball which he had picked up in the sea . </s>  The king ' s daughter ,  on getting the ruby put it in her hair ,  and ,  standing before her pet parrot ,  said to the bird ,   " Oh ,  my darling parrot ,  do not I look very beautiful with this ruby in my hair ?  "  The parrot replied ,   " Beautiful !  you look quite hideous with it !  What princess ever puts only one ruby in her hair ?  It would be somewhat feasible if you had two at least . </s>  "  Stung with shame at the reproach cast in her teeth by the parrot ,  the princess went into the grief-chamber of the palace ,  and would neither eat nor drink . </s>  The king was not a little concerned when he heard that his daughter had gone into the grief-chamber . He went to her ,  and asked her the cause of her grief . </s>  The princess told the king what her pet parrot had said ,  and added ,   " Father ,  if you do not procure for me another ruby like this ,  I will put an end to my life by mine own hands . </s>  "  The king was overwhelmed with grief . Where was he to get another ruby like it ?  He doubted whether another like it could be found in the whole world . </s>  He ordered the lad who had sold the ruby ,  to be brought into his presence . </s>  " Have you ,  young man ,  "  asked the king ,   " another ruby like the one you sold me ?  "  The lad replied :   " No ,  I have not got one . </s>  Why ,  do you want another ?  I can give you lots ,  if you wish to have them . They are to be found in a whirlpool in the sea ,  far ,  far away . </s>  I can go and fetch some for you . "  Amazed at the lad ' s reply ,  the king offered rich rewards for procuring only another ruby of the same sort . </s>  The lad went home and said to his mother that he must go to sea again to fetch some rubies for the king . </s>  The woman was quite frightened at the idea ,  and begged him not to go . But the lad was resolved on going ,  and nothing could prevent him from carrying out his purpose . </s>  He accordingly went alone on board that same vessel which had brought him and his mother ,  and set sail .

Horrified at the sight ,  he did not know what to make of it . </s>  He saw a stream of blood trickling from the severed head ,  falling upon the matted head of Siva ,  and running into the ocean in the form of rubies . </s>  After a little two small rods ,  one of silver and one of gold ,  which were lying near the head of the lady ,  attracted his eyes . </s>  As he took up the rods in his hands ,  the golden rod accidentally fell upon the head ,  on which the head immediately joined itself to the body ,  and the lady got up . </s>  Astonished at the sight of a human being ,  the lady asked the prince who he was and how he had got there . </s>  After hearing the story of the prince ' s adventures ,  the lady said ,   " Unhappy young man ,  depart instantly from this place ;  for when Siva finishes his meditations he will turn you to ashes by a single glance of his eyes .

" Well ,  here is the flitch ,  "  said the rich brother ,   " and now go straight to Hell . </s>  "   " What I have given my word to do ,  I must stick to ,  "  said the other ;  so he took the flitch and set off . </s>  He walked the whole day ,  and at dusk he came to a place where he saw a very bright light . " Maybe this is the place ,  "  said the man to himself . </s>  So he turned aside ,  and the first thing he saw was an old ,  old man ,  with a long white beard ,  who stood in an outhouse ,  hewing wood for the Christmas fire . </s>  " Good even ,  "  said the man with the flitch . " The same to you ;  whither are you going so late ?  "  said the man . </s>  " Oh !  I am going to Hell ,  if I only knew the right way ,  "  answered the poor man . </s>  " Well ,  you are not far wrong ,  for this is Hell ,  "  said the old man ;   " when you get inside they will be all for buying your flitch ,  for meat is scarce in Hell ;  but ,  mind you do not sell it unless you get the hand-quern which stands behind the door for it . </s>  When you come out ,  I will teach you how to handle the quern ,  for it ' s good to grind almost anything . </s>  "  So the man with the flitch thanked the other for his good advice ,  and gave a great knock at the Devil ' s door . </s>  When he got in ,  everything was just as the old man had said . </s>  All the devils ,  great and small ,  came swarming up to him like ants round an anthill ,  and each tried to outbid the other for the flitch . </s>  " Well !  "  said the man ,   " by rights ,  my old dame and I ought to have this flitch for our Christmas dinner ;  but since you have all set your hearts on it ,  I suppose I must give it up to you ;  but if I sell it at all ,  I will have for it the quern behind the door yonder . </s>  "  At first the Devil would not hear of such a bargain ,  and chaffed and haggled with the man ;  but he stuck to what he said ,  and at last the Devil had to part with his quern . </s>  When the man got out into the yard ,  he asked the old woodcutter how he was to handle the quern ;  and after he had learned how to use it ,  he thanked the old man and went off home as fast as he could ,  but still the clock had struck twelve on Christmas eve before he reached his own door . </s>  " Wherever in the world have you been ?  "  said his old dame ;   " here have I sat hour after hour waiting and watching ,  without so much as two sticks to lay together under the Christmas brose . </s>  "   " Oh !  "  said the man ,   " I could not get back before ,  for I had to go a long way first for one thing ,  and then for another ;  but now you shall see what you shall see . </s>  "  So he put the quern on the table ,  and bade it first of all grind lights ,  then a table-cloth ,  then meat ,  then ale ,  and so on till they had got everything that was nice for Christmas fare . </s>  He had only to speak the word ,  and the quern ground out what he wanted . </s>  The old dame stood by blessing her stars ,  and kept on asking where he had got this wonderful quern ,  but he would not tell her . </s>  " It ' s all one where I got it from ;  you see the quern is a good one ,  and the mill-stream never freezes ,  that ' s enough . </s>  "  So he ground meat and drink and dainties enough to last out till Twelfth Day ,  and on the third day he asked all his friends and kin to his house ,  and gave a great feast . </s>  Now ,  when his rich brother saw all that was on the table ,  and all that was behind in the larder ,  he grew quite spiteful and wild ,  for he could not bear that his brother should have anything . </s>  " Twas only on Christmas eve ,  "  he said to the rest ,   " he was in such straits that he came and asked for a morsel of food in God ' s name ,  and now he gives a feast as if he were count or king ;  "  and he turned to his brother and said :   " But whence ,  in Hell ' s name ,  have you got all this wealth ?  "   " From behind the door ,  "  answered the owner of the quern ,  for he did not care to let the cat out of the bag . </s>  But later on in the evening ,  when he had got a drop too much ,  he could keep his secret no longer ,  and brought out the quern and said :   " There ,  you see what has gotten me all this wealth ;  "  and so he made the quern grind all kind of things . </s>  When his brother saw it ,  he set his heart on having the quern ,  and ,  after a deal of coaxing ,  he got it ;  but he had to pay three hundred dollars for it ,  and his brother bargained to keep it till hay-harvest ,  for he thought ,  if I keep it till then ,  I can make it grind meat and drink that will last for years . </s>  So you may fancy the quern did not grow rusty for want of work ,  and when hay-harvest came ,  the rich brother got it ,  but the other took care not to teach him how to handle it . </s>  It was evening when the rich brother got the quern home ,  and the next morning he told his wife to go out into the hay-field and toss ,  while the mowers cut the grass ,  and he would stay at home and get the dinner ready . </s>  So ,  when dinner-time drew near ,  he put the quern on the kitchen table and said :   " Grind herrings and broth ,  and grind them good and fast . </s>  "  So the quern began to grind herrings and broth ;  first of all ,  all the dishes full ,  then all the tubs full ,  and so on till the kitchen floor was quite covered . </s>  Then the man twisted and twirled at the quern to get it to stop ,  but for all his twisting and fingering the quern went on grinding ,  and in a little while the broth rose so high that the man was like to drown . </s>  So he threw open the kitchen door and ran into the parlour ,  but it was not long before the quern had ground the parlour full too ,  and it was only at the risk of his life that the man could get hold of the latch of the house door through the stream of broth . </s>  When he got the door open ,  he ran out and set off down the road ,  with the stream of herrings and broth at his heels ,  roaring like a waterfall over the whole farm . </s>  Now ,  his old dame ,  who was in the field tossing hay ,  thought it a long time to dinner ,  and at last she said :   " Well !  though the master does not call us home ,  we may as well go . </s>  Maybe he finds it hard work to boil the broth ,  and will be glad of my help . </s>  "  The men were willing enough ,  so they sauntered homeward ;  but just as they had got a little way up the hill ,  what should they meet but herrings ,  and broth ,  and bread ,  all running and dashing ,  and splashing together in a stream ,  and the master himself running before them for his life ,  and as he passed them he bawled out :   " Would to heaven each of you had a hundred throats !  but take care you are not drowned in the broth .

" Sir ,  "  said Sir Cador ,   " the message brought by these lords is most welcome to me . </s>  We have spent full many days at rest and in idleness ,  and now my hope is that you will wage war against the Romans . </s>  In that war we shall ,  I have little doubt ,  win great honor . </s>  "   " I am sure ,  "  answered King Arthur ,   " that this affair is welcome to you ,  but I seek ,  above all ,  your aid in devising a grave and suitable answer to the demand they have made . </s>  And let no man doubt that I hold that demand to be a grievous insult . </s>  The tribute they claim ,  in my opinion ,  not only is not due ,  but cannot be due ;  for more than one British knight having been Emperor of Rome ,  it is ,  I hold ,  the duty of Rome to acknowledge the lordship of Britain ,  rather than of Britain to acknowledge that of Rome . </s>  What think ye ?

When they reigned over us ,  they oppressed our principal men ,  and laid heavy and extortionate burdens upon the land . </s>  For that cause I ,  standing here ,  solemnly vow vengeance upon them for the evil they then did ,  and ,  to support you in your quarrel ,  I will at my own cost furnish twenty thousand good fighting men . </s>  This force I will command in person ,  and I will bring it to your aid whenever you choose to summon me . </s>  "  In like manner ,  the King of Little Britain ,  as Brittany was called in those days ,  undertook to furnish thirty thousand men ;  and all the others who were present agreed to fight on King Arthur ' s side ,  and to assist him to the utmost of their power . </s>  So he ,  having thanked them heartily for the courage and good will towards him that they displayed ,  had the ambassadors summoned back into the banquet-hall and addressed them thus :   " I would have you go back to him who sent you ,  and I would have you say to him that I will pay no heed to any orders or demands that may be brought from him ;  and as for tribute so far am I from allowing that there is any tribute due from me or to any other man or prince upon earth ,  be he heathen or Christian ,  that I claim lordship over the empire he now has . </s>  And say further to him ,  that I have determined and resolved to go to Rome with my army ,  to take possession of the empire and to subdue all that behave themselves rebelliously . </s>  Therefore ,  let your master and all the other men of Rome get themselves ready to do homage to me ,  and to acknowledge me as their emperor and governor ,  and let them know that if they refuse ,  they will be punished befittingly . </s>  "  Then King Arthur bade his treasurer give handsome gifts to the ambassadors ,  and repay in full the cost of their journey ,  and he assigned Sir Cador as their escort to see them safely out of the country . </s>  So they took their leave ,  and going to Sandwich ,  sailed thence ,  and passed through Flanders and Germany over the Alps into Italy to the court of the Emperor . </s>  When the Emperor heard what message King Arthur had entrusted to them ,  and understood that this was indeed the reply to his demand for tribute ,  he was grievously angry . </s>  " Of truth ,  "  he said ,   " I never doubted that King Arthur would obey my commands and submit ,  as it befits him and all other kings to submit themselves to me . </s>  "   " Sir ,  "  answered one of the ambassadors ,   " I beseech you not to speak thus boastfully . </s>  In very truth my companions and myself were dismayed when we saw King Arthur face to face ,  and my fear is that you have made a rod for your own back ,  for his intention is to become lord over this empire . </s>  His threats ,  I warn you ,  are no idle talk . He is a very different man from what you hoped he was ,  and his court is the most noble upon earth . </s>  Never had any one of us beheld such magnificence as we beheld there on New Year ' s Day ,  when nine kings ,  besides other princes ,  lords ,  and knights ,  sat at table with King Arthur . </s>  Nor do I believe that there could be found anywhere another band of knights worthy to be matched with the knights who sit at his Round Table ,  nor a more manly man than the King himself . </s>  And since I verily believe his ambition is such that he would not be satisfied though he had conquered the whole world ,  my advice is that you have careful watch kept upon the borders of your lands and upon the ways over the mountains ,  for I am certain that you would do wisely to guard yourself well against him . </s>  "   " Well ,  "  answered Lucius ,   " my intention is before Easter to cross the Alps and to descend into France and seize the lands that belong to him there . </s>  With me I shall take my mighty warriors from Tuscany and Lombardy ,  and all the subjects and allies I have shall be summoned to my aid . </s>  "  Then the Emperor picked out wise old knights and sent them east and west throughout Asia ,  Africa ,  and Europe ,  to summon his allies from Turkey ,  Syria ,  Portugal ,  and the other distant lands that were subject to him ;  and in the meantime he assembled his forces from Rome ,  and from the countries between Rome and Flanders ,  and he collected together as his bodyguard fifty giants who were sons of evil spirits .

'  she answered grimly :  and ,  swift as lightning she picked up a steel cane that stood in the corner and laid it across his shoulders . </s>  In an instant his ears had grown long and his face longer ,  his arms had become legs ,  and his body was covered with close grey hair . </s>  Truly ,  he was an ass ;  and a very ugly one ,  too !

'   ' You talk too much . </s>  I shall break your head for you !  '  was all the answer she got . </s>  Had the young man looked at her face he might have taken warning ,  but he was busy making a pipe ,  and took no notice . </s>  The next moment the steel cane had touched his shoulders ,  and a big grey wolf bounded through the door . </s>  Oh !  what a yapping among the dogs ,  and what a shouting among the neighbours as they gave chase . </s>  For seven years he led the life of a hunted animal ,  often cold and nearly always hungry ,  and never daring to allow himself a sound sleep . </s>  At the end of that time his wolf skin wore out also ,  and again he appeared at the cottage door . </s>  But the second seven years had taught him no more than the first—his conduct was worse than before ;  and one day he beat his wife and son so brutally that they screamed to the old woman to come to their aid . </s>  She did ,  and brought the steel cane with her . </s>  In a second the ruffian had vanished ,  and a big black crow was flying about the room ,  crying  ' Gour !  Gour !  '  The window was open ,  and he darted through it ;  and seeking the companions who had ruined him ,  he managed to make them understand what had happened . </s>  ' We will avenge you ,  '  said they ;  and taking up a rope ,  set out to strangle the old woman . But she was ready for them . </s>  One stroke of her cane and they were all changed into a troop of black crows ,  and this time their feathers are lasting still .

Miss Bailey was intrusted with two dollars and ten cents ,  and the censorship of Morris . A day or so later Mrs . </s>  Mowgelewsky retired ,  indomitable ,  to her darkened room in the hospital ,  and the neighbors were inexorably shut out of her apartment . </s>  All their offers of help ,  all their proffers of advice were politely refused by Morris ,  all their questions and visits politely dodged . </s>  And every morning Miss Bailey handed her Monitor of the Goldfish Bowl his princely stipend ,  adding to it from time to time some fruit or other uncontaminated food ,  for Morris was religiously the strictest of the strict ,  and could have given cards and spades to many a minor rabbi [ 82-1 ]  on the intricacies of Kosher law .

"  said Tom . </s>  " That ' s my own business ,  not yours ,  "  was the reply . </s>  " Well ,  may be you had be civil enough to tell  _ us _  what you have got in the pitcher there ?

"   " Do as you please ,  "  said he ,   " but what I tell you is the truth . </s>  Did you never hear tell of the Danes ?  "   " Well ,  what about  _ them _  ?  "  said Tom . </s>  " Why ,  all the about them there is ,  is that when they were here they taught us to make beer out of the heath ,  and the secret ' s in my family ever since . </s>  "   " Will you give a body a taste of your beer ?

 it is cold in Blackburg when winter is on ,  and the snows are frequent and deep . </s>  There can be no doubt of it -- the snow in this instance was of the colour of blood and melted into water of the same hue ,  if water it was ,  not blood . </s>  The phenomenon had attracted wide attention ,  and science had as many explanations as there were scientists who knew nothing about it . </s>  But the men of Blackburg -- men who for many years had lived right there where the red snow fell ,  and might be supposed to know a good deal about the matter -- shook their heads and said something would come of it . </s>  And something did ,  for the next summer was made memorable by the prevalence of a mysterious disease -- epidemic ,  endemic ,  or the Lord knows what ,  though the physicians did not -- which carried away a full half of the population . </s>  Most of the other half carried themselves away and were slow to re- turn ,  but finally came back ,  and were now increasing and multiplying as before ,  but Blackburg had not since been altogether the same . </s>  Of quite another kind ,  though equally  ' out of the common ,  '  was the incident of Hetty Parlow ' s ghost . </s>  Hetty Parlow ' s maiden name had been Brownon ,  and in Blackburg that meant more than one would think . </s>  The Brownons had from time immemorial -- from the very earliest of the old colonial days -- been the leading family of the town . </s>  It was the richest and it was the best ,  and Blackburg would have shed the last drop of its plebeian blood in defence of the Brownon fair fame . </s>  As few of the family ' s mem- bers had ever been known to live permanently away from Blackburg ,  although most of them were educated elsewhere and nearly all had travelled ,  there was quite a number of them . </s>  The men held most of the public offices ,  and the women were foremost in all good works . </s>  Of these latter ,  Hetty was most be- loved by reason of the sweetness of her disposition ,  the purity of her character and her singular personal beauty . </s>  She married in Boston a young scape- grace named Parlow ,  and like a good Brownon brought him to Blackburg forthwith and made a man and a town councillor of him . </s>  They had a child which they named Joseph and dearly loved ,  as was then the fashion among parents in all that region . </s>  Then they died of the mysterious disorder already mentioned ,  and at the age of one whole year Joseph set up as an orphan . </s>  Unfortunately for Joseph the disease which had cut off his parents did not stop at that ;  it went on and extirpated nearly the whole Brownon contingent and its allies by marriage ;  and those who fled did not return . </s>  The tradition was broken ,  the Brownon estates passed into alien hands ,  and the only Brownons remaining in that place were underground in Oak Hill Cemetery ,  where ,  indeed ,  was a colony of them powerful enough to resist the encroachment of surrounding tribes and hold the best part of the grounds . </s>  But about the ghost :   One night ,  about three years after the death of Hetty Parlow ,  a number of the young people of Blackburg were passing Oak Hill Cemetery in a wagon -- if you have been there you will remember that the road to Greenton runs alongside it on the south . </s>  They had been attending a May Day festival at Greenton ;  and that serves to fix the date . </s>  Alto- gether there may have been a dozen ,  and a jolly party they were ,  considering the legacy of gloom left by the town ' s recent sombre experiences . </s>  As they passed the cemetery the man driving suddenly reined in his team with an exclamation of surprise . </s>  It was sufficiently surprising ,  no doubt ,  for just ahead ,  and almost at the roadside ,  though inside the cemetery ,  stood the ghost of Hetty Parlow . </s>  There could be no doubt of it ,  for she had been personally known to every youth and maiden in the party . </s>  That estab- lished the thing ' s identity ;  its character as ghost was signified by all the customary signs -- the shroud ,  the long ,  undone hair ,  the  ' far-away look '   -- everything . </s>  This disquieting apparition was stretching out its arms toward the west ,  as if in supplication for the evening star ,  which ,  certainly ,  was an alluring object ,  though obviously out of reach . </s>  As they all sat silent  ( so the story goes )  every member of that party of merrymakers -- they had merrymade on coffee and lemonade only -- distinctly heard that ghost call the name  ' Joey ,  Joey !  '  A mo- ment later nothing was there . </s>  Of course one does not have to believe all that . </s>  Now ,  at that moment ,  as was afterward ascer- tained ,  Joey was wandering about in the sagebrush on the opposite side of the continent ,  near Winne- mucca ,  in the State of Nevada . </s>  He had been taken to that town by some good persons distantly related to his dead father ,  and by them adopted and ten- derly cared for . </s>  But on that evening the poor child had strayed from home and was lost in the desert . His after history is involved in obscurity and has gaps which conjecture alone can fill . </s>  It is known that he was found by a family of Piute Indians ,  who kept the little wretch with them for a time and then sold him -- actually sold him for money to a woman on one of the east-bound trains ,  at a station a long way from Winnemucca . </s>  The woman professed to have made all manner of inquiries ,  but all in vain :  so ,  being childless and a widow ,  she adopted him herself . </s>  At this point of his career Jo seemed to be getting a long way from the condition of orphanage ;  the interposition of a multitude of parents between himself and that woeful state promised him a long immunity from its disadvantages . </s>  Mrs . Darnell ,  his newest mother ,  lived in Cleve- land ,  Ohio . But her adopted son did not long remain with her . </s>  He was seen one afternoon by a police- man ,  new to that beat ,  deliberately toddling away from her house ,  and being questioned answered that he was  ' a doin '  home . </s>  '  He must have travelled by rail ,  somehow ,  for three days later he was in the town of Whiteville ,  which ,  as you know ,  is a long way from Blackburg . </s>  His clothing was in pretty fair condition ,  but he was sinfully dirty . </s>  Unable to give any account of himself he was arrested as a vagrant and sentenced to imprisonment in the Infants '  Shel- tering Home -- where he was washed . </s>  Jo ran away from the Infants '  Sheltering Home at Whiteville -- just took to the woods one day ,  and the Home knew him no more for ever . </s>  We find him next ,  or rather get back to him ,  stand- ing forlorn in the cold autumn rain at a suburban street corner in Blackburg ;  and it seems right to explain now that the raindrops falling upon him there were really not dark and gummy ;  they only failed to make his face and hands less so . </s>  Jo was indeed fearfully and wonderfully besmirched ,  as by the hand of an artist . </s>  And the forlorn little tramp had no shoes ;  his feet were bare ,  red ,  and swollen ,  and when he walked he limped with both legs . </s>  As to clothing -- ah ,  you would hardly have had the skill to name any single garment that he wore ,  or say by what magic he kept it upon him .

Ganesh ,  also spelled as Ganesha ,  is one of the      best-known and most worshipped deities in Hinduism . </s>  Ganesh is born of divine parents and is himself a      divine being . </s>  According to the Hindu mythology ,  in the snow-capped mountains of Kailash ,  Lord Shiva and      Goddess Parvathi ,  the divine couple ,  live with their two divine children ,  Ganesh and his      brother Karthik ,  also known as Karthik . </s>  This is the tale of those days when both Ganesh and Karthik were very young . Ganesh being the elder son ,  was full of patience and wisdom . </s>  Karthik ,  on the      other hand ,  was impish and playful . But both of them were intelligent and      powerful . The two brothers had much difference in their physique . </s>  While Ganesh had a      massive body with a big belly and an elephant ' s head ,  young Karthik was a      beautiful boy with strong limbs . </s>  They were kind to everybody and were loved      by all . Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi loved their two children and they in turn      were devoted to their parents . </s>  The Devas  ( deities )  were pleased with the      lovely divine children and they worshipped them . </s>  But one day ,  as the Devas talked about the qualities of the brothers ,  a      doubt arose in the mind of one of them . </s>  " Who is the wiser of the two brothers ?  "  he asked the others  " Ganesh or      Karthik ?  "      Soon this doubt spread to all the Devas . </s>  All of them were talking and      expressing their opinion about the matter . But no one could surely decide      upon the matter . </s>  As they racked their brains to solve the issue ,  suddenly ,  a      Deva got an idea . “I know whom to ask ! ” ,  said he . </s>  As others looked at him curiously ,  he      continued ,   " Lord Brahma . He is the Creator of the world . </s>  He should know the      answer ,  so let ' s ask him !  He can surely solve this doubt . </s>  "      Without any more delay ,  the Devas rushed to Brahma and asked their Creator      about their doubt . Brahma was surprised to see all the deities ,  together . </s>  " Such a pleasant surprise !  What brings you here ?  "      The Devas told Brahma about their doubt . </s>  " O lord Brahma ,  who is the wiser      brother ?  "  ,  asked they ,   " Ganesh or Karthik ?  "       " Alas ,  I do not know !  "  replied Brahma . </s>  " I am the creator of mankind ,  not      divine beings . Ganesh and Karthik were born to the celestial gods Shiva and      Parvathi . "      The Devas were disappointed . </s>  Even the Brahma did not know !  Then they would      not be able to have an answer ,  after all . Looking at their glum faces ,  Lord Brahma decided to help them . </s>  " It is true      that I do not know who is the wiser of the two young Gods "  ,  he thought . </s>  " But      I can probably find it out with the help of my son Narada "  . </s>  Narada ,  the son of Lord Brahma ,  was a mischievous sage who was famous for      creating disputes . Wherever he went ,  he created trouble . </s>  But if he got away with all his pranks and without getting cursed it was      only because the trouble he caused usually ended on a happy note . " Narada ,  help the Devas . </s>  Find the answer to their question ,  "  said Brahma      after explaining the problem . </s>  " Certainly ,  Father ,  "  replied Narada ,  and his eyes twinkled naughtily ,       smelling an opportunity to play a prank . </s>  Using his magical powers Narada swiftly flew over the white mountains of      Kailash and ,  in no time ,  arrived at the divine abode of Shiva and Parvathi . </s>  He was warmly welcomed by the heavenly couple . " 0 Shive ,  Saviour of the Universe !  ,  O Devi Parvathi  !  "  Narada praised the      lord . " I thank you for your warm welcome . </s>  It is indeed a pleasant joy and an      honour to see you both together as the Divine couple "  . Everyone knew about Narada ' s mischievous nature . </s>  Shiva understood that      Narada was up to some mischief . " Now tell us the truth . I can sense some      mischief brewing in your mind . </s>  What is the prank you are planning to play on      us ?  "  he said jokingly . Narada pretended to be hurt . </s>  " You greatly insult me ,  Lord Shiva !  I have just      come here to give you a gift ,  "  he said in a sorrowful voice . </s>  " A gift for me ?  What is it Narada ?  "  ,  asked Lord Shiva . Narada ,  hearing the      eagerness in Shiva ' s voice smiled to himself in amusement . </s>  He produced a      golden mango and gave it to the Lord . " A mango !  "  exclaimed Shiva . " Now do not say you travelled all the way here to      give me this fruit . </s>  "       " It is no ordinary fruit ,  my Lord ,  "  Narada replied . " The taste of this fruit      is said to be sweeter than nectar . </s>  This is the divine fruit of knowledge      that bestows eternal wisdom to those who eat it . " Is it so ?  "  asked Shiva ,  looking at the mango . </s>  He then asked his wife      Parvathi to have a bite . " No ,  stop !  "  cried Narada . " What are you doing ?  "      Lord Shiva looked at Narada curiously . </s>  " Why ?  Do you want me to eat it      without letting Parvathi taste it ?  I am going to share it with her "  . </s>  Saying      so ,  he turned to share the fruit with his wife ,  Goddess Parvathi . Narada shook his head in disagreement . " That cannot be done ,  Lord Shiva . </s>  It      is a magical fruit ,  blessed by the sages and Devas . It is not possible to      cut the mango into pieces . </s>  It should be eaten by a single person as a whole      fruit "  . The divine couple looked at each other . They were confused . Then Lord Shiva      shrugged . </s>  " If that is the case ,  let my better half have this fruit . </s>  Here      Parvathi ,  you can have this whole mango ,  "  he said ,  offering the mango to his      wife . Parvathi was surprised . </s>  " Oh no ,  I do not want it !  You are my husband . How can      I eat it without you having a taste of it ?  "  she refused . </s>  Both Lord Shiva and Narada requested her to eat the fruit but Parvathi      steadily declined . " Instead ,  let one of our children have the fruit ,  "  she      suggested . </s>  " But ,  how is that possible ?  "  asked Narada slyly . " There is one fruit and two      children . </s>  Who should be given the fruit - Ganesh or Karthik ?  "       While the elders were talking ,  Ganesh and Karthik appeared in Kailash . </s>  They      saw that their parents and Sage Narada were having some serious talk on      something . Then Karthik noticed something yellow and round in Narada ' s hand . </s>  “What is Uncle Narada having in his hand  ? ” Karthik asked to Ganesh . Ganesh      was equally curious . </s>  “ This is a magical mango ,  Karthik ,   " Narada replied ,  as he heard Karthik ' s      question . " I gave it to your Father but he wanted your Mother to eat it . </s>  But      she wo not have it . She wants to give it to one of you "  . </s>  " A magical mango ?  I love mangoes !  "  ,  shouted Karthik ,   " I want it !  I want      it !  "  . " No ,  no ,  it should come to me . </s>  I love mangoes too !  I am the eldest son and      the right one to eat the fruit of knowledge ,  "  argued Ganesh . Soon the      brothers started fighting . </s>  The divine parents were perplexed . This is nothing but a mountain out of a      molehill . Lord Shiva looked at Narada . </s>  " So this is why you came to Kailash !       I knew it !  I knew there was something in your mind . Well done Narada ,  you      have finally played the trick . </s>  This is why you came here .

"      As Anjana looked at the warrior in admiration ,  the man turned and saw her . </s>  As soon as his eyes fell on her ,  she turned into a monkey !      With a pathetic cry ,  Anjana sank to the ground and covered her face with her      hands . </s>  Seeing her fall to the ground ,  the man came running towards her . " Who are you fair maiden ?

If you become my wife ,  I      will be honoured . </s>  Would you honour me by becoming my wife ,  dear Anjana ?  "  . Anjana became very happy .

She opened her eyes and looked at      the payasa in her hand . " Is this offering from Lord Shiva ?  "  she wondered and      swallowed it . </s>  As the divine pudding went inside her throat ,  Anjana immediately felt the      blessings of Lord Shiva . In due course ,  she gave birth to a little      monkey-faced boy . </s>  Kesari was very happy to see his son . The child was called      as Anjaneya or the son of Anjana . </s>  Having given birth to Lord Shiva ' s incarnation ,  Anjana was released from the      curse of the sage .

"      Saying so ,  Anjana kissed her son and left her alone . </s>  She went back to her      heavenly abode . " Fruits as red and ripe as the sun ?  "  thought Anjaneya . </s>  " Is sun such a ripe      fruit ?  Let ' s see !  "      Thinking that the sun was actually some delicious fruit ,  the baby Anjaneya      wanted to taste the sun . </s>  Now ,  Anjaneya was a divine child . His mother was an      apsara and his father was a Monkey-King ,  so it was natural that little      Anjaneya should inherit some magical powers . </s>  He was ,  after all ,  an      incarnation of Lord Shiva .

 which was no wonder ,  it being almost two days since I had last disburdened myself . </s>  I was under great difficulties between urgency and shame . </s>  The best expedient I could think of ,  was to creep into my house ,  which I accordingly did ;  and shutting the gate after me ,  I went as far as the length of my chain would suffer ,  and discharged my body of that uneasy load . </s>  But this was the only time I was ever guilty of so uncleanly an action ;  for which I cannot but hope the candid reader will give some allowance ,  after he has maturely and impartially considered my case ,  and the distress I was in . </s>  From this time my constant practice was ,  as soon as I rose ,  to perform that business in open air ,  at the full extent of my chain ;  and due care was taken every morning before company came ,  that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheel-barrows ,  by two servants appointed for that purpose . </s>  I would not have dwelt so long upon a circumstance that ,  perhaps ,  at first sight ,  may appear not very momentous ,  if I had not thought it necessary to justify my character ,  in point of cleanliness ,  to the world ;  which ,  I am told ,  some of my maligners have been pleased ,  upon this and other occasions ,  to call in question . </s>  When this adventure was at an end ,  I came back out of my house ,  having occasion for fresh air . </s>  The emperor was already descended from the tower ,  and advancing on horseback towards me ,  which had like to have cost him dear ;  for the beast ,  though very well trained ,  yet wholly unused to such a sight ,  which appeared as if a mountain moved before him ,  reared up on its hinder feet :  but that prince ,  who is an excellent horseman ,  kept his seat ,  till his attendants ran in ,  and held the bridle ,  while his majesty had time to dismount . </s>  When he alighted ,  he surveyed me round with great admiration ;  but kept beyond the length of my chain . </s>  He ordered his cooks and butlers ,  who were already prepared ,  to give me victuals and drink ,  which they pushed forward in a sort of vehicles upon wheels ,  till I could reach them . </s>  I took these vehicles and soon emptied them all ;  twenty of them were filled with meat ,  and ten with liquor ;  each of the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls ;  and I emptied the liquor of ten vessels ,  which was contained in earthen vials ,  into one vehicle ,  drinking it off at a draught ;  and so I did with the rest . </s>  The empress ,  and young princes of the blood of both sexes ,  attended by many ladies ,  sat at some distance in their chairs ;  but upon the accident that happened to the emperor’s horse ,  they alighted ,  and came near his person ,  which I am now going to describe . </s>  He is taller by almost the breadth of my nail ,  than any of his court ;  which alone is enough to strike an awe into the beholders . </s>  His features are strong and masculine ,  with an Austrian lip and arched nose ,  his complexion olive ,  his countenance erect ,  his body and limbs well proportioned ,  all his motions graceful ,  and his deportment majestic . </s>  He was then past his prime ,  being twenty-eight years and three quarters old ,  of which he had reigned about seven in great felicity ,  and generally victorious . </s>  For the better convenience of beholding him ,  I lay on my side ,  so that my face was parallel to his ,  and he stood but three yards off :  however ,  I have had him since many times in my hand ,  and therefore cannot be deceived in the description . </s>  His dress was very plain and simple ,  and the fashion of it between the Asiatic and the European ;  but he had on his head a light helmet of gold ,  adorned with jewels ,  and a plume on the crest . </s>  He held his sword drawn in his hand to defend himself ,  if I should happen to break loose ;  it was almost three inches long ;  the hilt and scabbard were gold enriched with diamonds . </s>  His voice was shrill ,  but very clear and articulate ;  and I could distinctly hear it when I stood up . </s>  The ladies and courtiers were all most magnificently clad ;  so that the spot they stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread upon the ground ,  embroidered with figures of gold and silver . </s>  His imperial majesty spoke often to me ,  and I returned answers :  but neither of us could understand a syllable . </s>  There were several of his priests and lawyers present  ( as I conjectured by their habits )  ,  who were commanded to address themselves to me ;  and I spoke to them in as many languages as I had the least smattering of ,  which were High and Low Dutch ,  Latin ,  French ,  Spanish ,  Italian ,  and Lingua Franca ,  but all to no purpose . </s>  After about two hours the court retired ,  and I was left with a strong guard ,  to prevent the impertinence ,  and probably the malice of the rabble ,  who were very impatient to crowd about me as near as they durst ;  and some of them had the impudence to shoot their arrows at me ,  as I sat on the ground by the door of my house ,  whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye . </s>  But the colonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized ,  and thought no punishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands ;  which some of his soldiers accordingly did ,  pushing them forward with the butt-ends of their pikes into my reach . </s>  I took them all in my right hand ,  put five of them into my coat-pocket ;  and as to the sixth ,  I made a countenance as if I would eat him alive . </s>  The poor man squalled terribly ,  and the colonel and his officers were in much pain ,  especially when they saw me take out my penknife :  but I soon put them out of fear ;  for ,  looking mildly ,  and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with ,  I set him gently on the ground ,  and away he ran . </s>  I treated the rest in the same manner ,  taking them one by one out of my pocket ;  and I observed both the soldiers and people were highly delighted at this mark of my clemency ,  which was represented very much to my advantage at court . </s>  Towards night I got with some difficulty into my house ,  where I lay on the ground ,  and continued to do so about a fortnight ;  during which time ,  the emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me . </s>  Six hundred beds of the common measure were brought in carriages ,  and worked up in my house ;  a hundred and fifty of their beds ,  sewn together ,  made up the breadth and length ;  and these were four double :  which ,  however ,  kept me but very indifferently from the hardness of the floor ,  that was of smooth stone . </s>  By the same computation ,  they provided me with sheets ,  blankets ,  and coverlets ,  tolerable enough for one who had been so long inured to hardships . </s>  As the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom ,  it brought prodigious numbers of rich ,  idle ,  and curious people to see me ;  so that the villages were almost emptied ;  and great neglect of tillage and household affairs must have ensued ,  if his imperial majesty had not provided ,  by several proclamations and orders of state ,  against this inconveniency . </s>  He directed that those who had already beheld me should return home ,  and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house ,  without license from the court ;  whereby the secretaries of state got considerable fees .

They journeyed over hill and dale till they came to a place called Goldtown . </s>  The King of Goldtown had a lovely daughter ,  and the prince ,  who soon heard about her beauty ,  could not rest till he saw her . </s>  He was very kindly received ,  for he was extremely good-looking and had charming manners ,  so he lost no time in asking for her hand and her parents gave her to him with joy . </s>  The wedding took place at once ,  and the feasting and rejoicings went on for a whole month . </s>  At the end of the month they set off for home ,  but as the journey was a long one they spent the first evening at an inn . </s>  Everyone in the house slept ,  and only the faithful servant kept watch . About midnight he heard three crows ,  who had flown to the roof ,  talking together . </s>  ' That ' s a handsome couple which arrived here tonight . It seems quite a pity they should lose their lives so soon . </s>  '   ' Truly ,  '  said the second crow ;   ' for to-morrow ,  when midday strikes ,  the bridge over the Gold Stream will break just as they are driving over it . </s>  But ,  listen !  whoever overhears and tells what we have said will be turned to stone up to his knees . '  The crows had hardly done speaking when away they flew . </s>  And close upon them followed three pigeons . </s>  ' Even if the prince and princess get safe over the bridge they will perish ,  '  said they ;   ' for the king is going to send a carriage to meet them which looks as new as paint . </s>  But when they are seated in it a raging wind will rise and whirl the carriage away into the clouds .

'  And the lid of the basket closed with a snap . </s>  Father Grumbler sighed with relief and happiness as he looked around him ,  and sitting down on a heap of stones ,  he ate till he could eat no more . </s>  Trout ,  salmon ,  turbot ,  soles ,  and a hundred other fishes whose names he did not know ,  lay boiled ,  fried ,  and grilled within reach of his hands . </s>  As the Holy Man had said ,  he had never eaten such a dinner ;  still ,  when he had done ,  he shook his head ,  and grumbled ;   ' Yes ,  there is plenty to eat ,  of course ,  but it only makes me thirsty ,  and there is not a drop to drink anywhere . </s>  '  Yet ,  somehow ,  he could never tell why ,  he looked up and saw the tavern in front of him ,  which he thought was miles ,  and miles ,  and miles away . </s>  ' Bring the best wine you have got ,  and two glasses ,  good mother ,  '  he said as he entered ,   ' and if you are fond of fish there is enough here to feed the house . </s>  Only there is no need to chatter about it all over the place . </s>  You understand ?  Eh ?  '  And without waiting for an answer he whispered to the basket :   ' Little basket ,  little basket ,  do your duty . </s>  '  The innkeeper and his wife thought that their customer had gone suddenly mad ,  and watched him closely ,  ready to spring on him if he became violent ;  but both instinctively jumped backwards ,  nearly into the fire ,  as rolls and fishes of every kind came tumbling out of the basket ,  covering the tables and chairs and the floor ,  and even overflowing into the street . </s>  ' Be quick ,  be quick ,  and pick them up ,  '  cried the man . ' And if these are not enough ,  there are plenty more to be had for the asking . </s>  '  The innkeeper and his wife did not need telling twice . Down they went on their knees and gathered up everything they could lay hands on . </s>  But busy though they seemed ,  they found time to whisper to each other :   ' If we can only get hold of that basket it will make our fortune !  '  So they began by inviting Father Grumbler to sit down to the table ,  and brought out the best wine in the cellar ,  hoping it might loosen his tongue . </s>  But Father Grumbler was wiser than they gave him credit for ,  and though they tried in all manner of ways to find out who had given him the basket ,  he put them off ,  and kept his secret to himself . </s>  Unluckily ,  though he did not SPEAK ,  he did drink ,  and it was not long before he fell fast asleep . </s>  Then the woman fetched from her kitchen a basket ,  so like the magic one that no one ,  without looking very closely ,  could tell the difference ,  and placed it in Father Grumbler ' s hand ,  while she hid the other carefully away . </s>  It was dinner time when the man awoke ,  and ,  jumping up hastily ,  he set out for home ,  where he found all the children gathered round a basin of thin soup ,  and pushing their wooden bowls forward ,  hoping to have the first spoonful . </s>  Their father burst into the midst of them ,  bearing his basket ,  and crying :   ' Do not spoil your appetites ,  children ,  with that stuff . </s>  Do you see this basket ?  Well ,  I have only got to say ,   " Little basket ,  little basket ,  do your duty ,  "  and you will see what will happen . </s>  Now you shall say it instead of me ,  for a treat . '  The children ,  wondering and delighted ,  repeated the words ,  but nothing happened . </s>  Again and again they tried ,  but the basket was only a basket ,  with a few scales of fish sticking to the bottom ,  for the innkeeper ' s wife had taken it to market the day before . </s>  ' What is the matter with the thing ?  '  cried the father at last ,  snatching the basket from them ,  and turning it all over ,  grumbling and swearing while he did so ,  under the eyes of his astonished wife and children ,  who did not know whether to cry or to laugh . </s>  ' It certainly smells of fish ,  '  he said ,  and then he stopped ,  for a sudden thought had come to him . </s>  ' Suppose it is not mine at all ;  supposing -- Ah ,  the scoundrels !  '  And without listening to his wife and children ,  who were frightened at his strange conduct and begged him to stay at home ,  he ran across to the tavern and burst open the door .

' But I cannot go without telling my parents . </s>  I am sure they will think me lucky to get such a chance . '  As soon as the business was finished ,  Rosald hastened home . </s>  His parents were delighted to hear of his good fortune ,  and his father gave him his own sword ,  which was growing rusty for want of use ,  while his mother saw that his leather jerkin was in order . </s>  ' Be sure you keep the promise you made to Geirald ,  '  said she ,  as she bade him good-bye ,   ' and ,  come what may ,  see that you never betray him . </s>  '  Full of joy Rosald rode off ,  and the next day he and Geirald started off to seek adventures . </s>  To their disappointment their own land was so well governed that nothing out of the common was very likely to happen ,  but directly they crossed the border into another kingdom all seemed lawlessness and confusion . </s>  They had not gone very far ,  when ,  riding across a mountain ,  they caught a glimpse of several armed men hiding amongst some trees in their path ,  and remembered suddenly some talk they had heard of a band of twelve robbers who lay in wait for rich travellers . </s>  The robbers were more like savage beasts than men ,  and lived somewhere at the top of the mountain in caves and holes in the ground . </s>  They were all called  ' Hankur ,  '  and were distinguished one from another by the name of a colour -- blue ,  grey ,  red ,  and so on ,  except their chief ,  who was known as Hankur the Tall . </s>  All this and more rushed into the minds of the two young men as they saw the flash of their swords in the moonlight . </s>  ' It is impossible to fight them -- they are twelve to two ,  '  whispered Geirald ,  stopping his horse in the path . ' We had much better ride back and take the lower road . </s>  It would be stupid to throw away our lives like this . </s>  '   ' Oh ,  we ca not turn back ,  '  answered Rosald ,   ' we should be ashamed to look anyone in the face again !  And ,  besides ,  it is a grand opportunity to show what we are made of . </s>  Let us tie up our horses here ,  and climb up the rocks so that we can roll stones down on them . </s>  '   ' Well ,  we might try that ,  and then we shall always have our horses ,  '  said Geirald . So they went up the rocks silently and carefully . </s>  The robbers were lying all ready ,  expecting every moment to see their victims coming round the corner a few yards away ,  when a shower of huge stones fell on their heads ,  killing half the band . </s>  The others sprang up the rock ,  but as they reached the top the sword of Rosald swung round ,  and one man after another rolled down into the valley . </s>  At last the chief managed to spring up ,  and ,  grasping Rosald by the waist ,  flung away his sword ,  and the two fought desperately ,  their bodies swaying always nearer the edge . </s>  It seemed as if Rosald ,  being the smaller of the two ,  MUST fall over ,  when ,  with his left hand ,  he drew the robber ' s sword out of its sheath and plunged it into his heart . </s>  Then he took from the dead man a beautiful ring set with a large stone ,  and put it on his own finger . </s>  The fame of this wonderful deed soon spread through the country ,  and people would often stop Geirald ' s horse ,  and ask leave to see the robber ' s ring ,  which was said to have been stolen from the father of the reigning king . </s>  And Geirald showed them the ring with pride ,  and listened to their words of praise ,  and no one would ever have guessed anyone else had destroyed the robbers . </s>  In a few days they left the kingdom and rode on to another ,  where they thought they would stop through the remainder of the winter ,  for Geirald liked to be comfortable ,  and did not care about travelling through ice and snow . </s>  But the king would only grant them leave to stop on condition that ,  before the winter was ended ,  they should give him some fresh proof of the courage of which he had heard so much . </s>  Rosald ' s heart was glad at the king ' s message ,  and as for Geirald ,  he felt that as long as Rosald was there all would go well . </s>  So they both bowed low and replied that it was the king ' s place to command and theirs to obey . </s>  ' Well ,  then ,  '  said his Majesty ,   ' this is what I want you to do :  In the north-east part of my kingdom there dwells a giant ,  who has an iron staff twenty yards long ,  and he is so quick in using it ,  that even fifty knights have no chance against him . </s>  The bravest and strongest young men of my court have fallen under the blows of that staff ;  but ,  as you overcame the twelve robbers so easily ,  I feel that I have reason to hope that you may be able to conquer the giant . </s>  In three days from this you will set out . '   ' We will be ready ,  your Majesty ,  '  answered Rosald ;  but Geirald remained silent . </s>  ' How can we possibly fight against a giant that has killed fifty knights ?  '  cried Geirald ,  when they were outside the castle . </s>  ' The king only wants to get rid of us !  He wo not think about us for the next three days -- that is one comfort -- so we shall have plenty of time to cross the borders of the kingdom and be out of reach . </s>  '   ' We may not be able to kill the giant ,  but we certainly ca not run away till we have tried ,  '  answered Rosald . </s>  ' Besides ,  think how glorious it will be if we DO manage to kill him !  I know what sort of weapon I shall use . Come with me now ,  and I will see about it . </s>  '  And ,  taking his friend by the arm ,  he led him into a shop where he bought a huge lump of solid iron ,  so big that they could hardly lift it between them . </s>  However ,  they just managed to carry it to a blacksmith ' s where Rosald directed that it should be beaten into a thick club ,  with a sharp spike at one end . </s>  When this was done to his liking he took it home under his arm . </s>  Very early on the third morning the two young men started on their journey ,  and on the fourth day they reached the giant ' s cave before he was out of bed . </s>  Hearing the sound of footsteps ,  the giant got up and went to the entrance to see who was coming ,  and Rosald ,  expecting something of the sort ,  struck him such a blow on the forehead that he fell to the ground .

'  he asked anxiously . The fairies looked at him ,  and all shook their heads at once . </s>  ' He is a beautiful boy ,  and it is a great pity ;  but what IS to happen WILL happen ,  '  said they . </s>  ' It is written in the books of fate that he must die ,  either by a crocodile ,  or a serpent ,  or by a dog . </s>  If we could save him we would ;  but that is beyond our power . '  And so saying they vanished . </s>  For a time the king stood where he was ,  horror-stricken at what he had heard ;  but ,  being of a hopeful nature ,  he began at once to invent plans to save the prince from the dreadful doom that awaited him . </s>  He instantly sent for his master builder ,  and bade him construct a strong castle on the top of a mountain ,  which should be fitted with the most precious things from the king ' s own palace ,  and every kind of toy a child could wish to play with . </s>  And ,  besides ,  he gave the strictest orders that a guard should walk round the castle night and day . </s>  For four or five years the baby lived in the castle alone with his nurses ,  taking his airings on the broad terraces ,  which were surrounded by walls ,  with a moat beneath them ,  and only a drawbridge to connect them with the outer world . </s>  One day ,  when the prince was old enough to run quite fast by himself ,  he looked from the terrace across the moat ,  and saw a little soft fluffy ball of a dog jumping and playing on the other side . </s>  Now ,  of course ,  all dogs had been kept from him for fear that the fairies '  prophecy should come true ,  and he had never even beheld one before . </s>  So he turned to the page who was walking behind him ,  and said :   ' What is that funny little thing which is running so fast over there ?  '   ' That is a dog ,  prince ,  '  answered the page . </s>  ' Well ,  bring me one like it ,  and we will see which can run the faster . '  And he watched the dog till it had disappeared round the corner . </s>  The page was much puzzled to know what to do . He had strict orders to refuse the prince nothing ;  yet he remembered the prophecy ,  and felt that this was a serious matter . </s>  At last he thought he had better tell the king the whole story ,  and let him decide the question . </s>  ' Oh ,  get him a dog if he wants one ,  '  said the king ,   ' he will only cry his heart out if he does not have it . </s>  '  So a puppy was found ,  exactly like the other ;  they might have been twins ,  and perhaps they were . </s>  Years went by ,  and the boy and the dog played together till the boy grew tall and strong . </s>  The time came at last when he sent a message to his father ,  saying :   ' Why do you keep me shut up here ,  doing nothing ?  I know all about the prophecy that was made at my birth ,  but I would far rather be killed at once than live an idle ,  useless life here . </s>  So give me arms ,  and let me go ,  I pray you ;  me and my dog too . </s>  '  And again the king listened to his wishes ,  and he and his dog were carried in a ship to the other side of the river ,  which was so broad here it might almost have been the sea . </s>  A black horse was waiting for him ,  tied to a tree ,  and he mounted and rode away wherever his fancy took him ,  the dog always at his heels . </s>  Never was any prince so happy as he ,  and he rode and rode till at length he came to a king ' s palace . </s>  The king who lived in it did not care about looking after his country ,  and seeing that his people lived cheerful and contented lives . </s>  He spent his whole time in making riddles ,  and inventing plans which he had much better have let alone . </s>  At the period when the young prince reached the kingdom he had just completed a wonderful house for his only child ,  a daughter . </s>  It had seventy windows ,  each seventy feet from the ground ,  and he had sent the royal herald round the borders of the neighbouring kingdoms to proclaim that whoever could climb up the walls to the window of the princess should win her for his wife . </s>  The fame of the princess ' s beauty had spread far and wide ,  and there was no lack of princes who wished to try their fortune . </s>  Very funny the palace must have looked each morning ,  with the dabs of different colour on the white marble as the princes were climbing up the walls . </s>  But though some managed to get further than others ,  nobody was anywhere near the top . </s>  They had already been spending several days in this manner when the young prince arrived ,  and as he was pleasant to look upon ,  and civil to talk to ,  they welcomed him to the house ,  which had been given to them ,  and saw that his bath was properly perfumed after his long journey . </s>  ' Where do you come from ?  '  they said at last . </s>  ' And whose son are you ?  '  But the young prince had reasons for keeping his own secret ,  and he answered :   ' My father was master of the horse to the king of my country ,  and after my mother died he married another wife . </s>  At first all went well ,  but as soon as she had babies of her own she hated me ,  and I fled ,  lest she should do me harm . </s>  '  The hearts of the other young men were touched as soon as they heard this story ,  and they did everything they could think of to make him forget his past sorrows . </s>  ' What are you doing here ?  '  said the youth ,  one day . </s>  ' We spend our whole time climbing up the walls of the palace ,  trying to reach the windows of the princess ,  '  answered the young men ;   ' but ,  as yet ,  no one has reached within ten feet of them . </s>  '   ' Oh ,  let me try too ,  '  cried the prince ;   ' but to-morrow I will wait and see what you do before I begin . </s>  So the next day he stood where he could watch the young men go up ,  and he noted the places on the wall that seemed most difficult ,  and made up his mind that when his turn came he would go up some other way . </s>  Day after day he was to be seen watching the wooers ,  till ,  one morning ,  he felt that he knew the plan of the walls by heart ,  and took his place by the side of the others . </s>  Thanks to what he had learned from the failure of the rest ,  he managed to grasp one little rough projection after another ,  till at last ,  to the envy of his friends ,  he stood on the sill of the princess ' s window . </s>  Looking up from below ,  they saw a white hand stretched forth to draw him in . </s>  Then one of the young men ran straight to the king ' s palace ,  and said :   ' The wall has been climbed ,  and the prize is won !  '   ' By whom ?  '  cried the king ,  starting up from his throne ;   ' which of the princes may I claim as my son-in-law ?  '   ' The youth who succeeded in climbing to the princess ' s window is not a prince at all ,  '  answered the young man . </s>  ' He is the son of the master of the horse to the great king who dwells across the river ,  and he fled from his own country to escape from the hatred of his stepmother .

He left them one day ,  and walked off in search of adventures . </s>  In a wide open space surrounded by trees he met with an elephant ,  who was having his supper before taking his evening bath in the river which ran close by . </s>  ' Let us see which of us two is strongest ,  '  said the young tortoise ,  marching up to the elephant . </s>  ' Very well ,  '  replied the elephant ,  much amused at the impertinence of the little creature ;   ' when would you like the trial to be ?  '   ' In an hour ' s time ;  I have some business to do first ,  '  answered the tortoise . </s>  And he hastened away as fast as his short legs would carry him . In a pool of the river a whale was resting ,  blowing water into the air and making a lovely fountain . </s>  The tortoise ,  however ,  was too young and too busy to admire such things ,  and he called to the whale to stop ,  as he wanted to speak to him . </s>  ' Would you like to try which of us is the stronger ?  '  said he . The whale looked at him ,  sent up another fountain ,  and answered :   ' Oh ,  yes ;  certainly . </s>  When do you wish to begin ?  I am quite ready . '   ' Then give me one of your longest bones ,  and I will fasten it to my leg . </s>  When I give the signal ,  you must pull ,  and we will see which can pull the hardest . </s>  '   ' Very good ,  '  replied the whale ;  and he took out one of his bones and passed it to the tortoise . </s>  The tortoise picked up the end of the bone in his mouth and went back to the elephant . </s>  ' I will fasten this to your leg ,  '  said he ,   ' in the same way as it is fastened to mine ,  and we must both pull as hard as we can . </s>  We shall soon see which is the stronger . '  So he wound it carefully round the elephant ' s leg ,  and tied it in a firm knot . </s>  ' Now !  '  cried he ,  plunging into a thick bush behind him . </s>  The whale tugged at one end ,  and the elephant tugged at the other ,  and neither had any idea that he had not the tortoise for his foe . </s>  When the whale pulled hardest the elephant was dragged into the water ;  and when the elephant pulled the hardest the whale was hauled on to the land . </s>  They were very evenly matched ,  and the battle was a hard one . At last they were quite tired ,  and the tortoise ,  who was watching ,  saw that they could play no more . </s>  So he crept from his hiding-place ,  and dipping himself in the river ,  he went to the elephant and said :   ' I see that you really are stronger than I thought . </s>  Suppose we give it up for to-day ?  '  Then he dried himself on some moss and went to the whale and said :   ' I see that you really are stronger than I thought . </s>  Suppose we give it up for to-day ?  '  The two adversaries were only too glad to be allowed to rest ,  and believed to the end of their days that ,  after all ,  the tortoise was stronger than either of them . </s>  A day or two later the young tortoise was taking a stroll ,  when he met a fox ,  and stopped to speak to him . </s>  ' Let us try ,  '  said he in a careless manner ,   ' which of us can lie buried in the ground during seven years . </s>  '   ' I shall be delighted ,  '  answered the fox ,   ' only I would rather that you began . </s>  '   ' It is all the same to me ,  '  replied the tortoise ;   ' if you come round this way to-morrow you will see that I have fulfilled my part of the bargain . </s>  '  So he looked about for a suitable place ,  and found a convenient hole at the foot of an orange tree . </s>  He crept into it ,  and the next morning the fox heaped up the earth round him ,  and promised to feed him every day with fresh fruit . </s>  The fox so far kept his word that each morning when the sun rose he appeared to ask how the tortoise was getting on . </s>  ' Oh ,  very well ;  but I wish you would give me some fruit ,  '  replied he . </s>  ' Alas !  the fruit is not ripe enough yet for you to eat ,  '  answered the fox ,  who hoped that the tortoise would die of hunger long before the seven years were over . </s>  ' Oh dear ,  oh dear !  I am so hungry !  '  cried the tortoise . </s>  ' I am sure you must be ;  but it will be all right to-morrow ,  '  said the fox ,  trotting off ,  not knowing that the oranges dropped down the hollow trunk ,  straight into the tortoise ' s hole ,  and that he had as many as he could possibly eat . </s>  So the seven years went by ;  and when the tortoise came out of his hole he was as fat as ever . </s>  Now it was the fox ' s turn ,  and he chose his hole ,  and the tortoise heaped the earth round ,  promising to return every day or two with a nice young bird for his dinner . </s>  ' Well ,  how are you getting on ?  '  he would ask cheerfully when he paid his visits . </s>  ' Oh ,  all right ;  only I wish you had brought a bird with you ,  '  answered the fox . </s>  ' I have been so unlucky ,  I have never been able to catch one ,  '  replied the tortoise . ' However ,  I shall be more fortunate to-morrow ,  I am sure . </s>  '  But not many to-morrows after ,  when the tortoise arrived with his usual question :   ' Well ,  how are you getting on ?  '  he received no answer ,  for the fox was lying in his hole quite still ,  dead of hunger . </s>  By this time the tortoise was grown up ,  and was looked up to throughout the forest as a person to be feared for his strength and wisdom . </s>  But he was not considered a very swift runner ,  until an adventure with a deer added to his fame . </s>  One day ,  when he was basking in the sun ,  a stag passed by ,  and stopped for a little conversation . </s>  ' Would you care to see which of us can run fastest ?

' Ah ,  how good !  '  cried the shark . ' Send me another ,  please . </s>  '  And the monkey grew tired of picking the kuyu long before the shark was tired of eating them . </s>  ' It is getting late ,  and I must be going home to my children ,  '  he said ,  at length ,   ' but if you are here at the same time to-morrow I will give you another treat . </s>  '   ' Thank you ,  thank you ,  '  said the shark ,  showing all his great ugly teeth as he grinned with delight ;   ' you ca not guess how happy you have made me ,  '  and he swam away into the shadow ,  hoping to sleep away the time till the monkey came again . </s>  For weeks the monkey and the shark breakfasted together ,  and it was a wonder that the tree had any fruit left for them . </s>  They became fast friends ,  and told each other about their homes and their children ,  and how to teach them all they ought to know . </s>  By and bye the monkey became rather discontented with his green house in a grove of palms beyond the town ,  and longed to see the strange things under the sea which he had heard of from the shark . </s>  The shark perceived this very clearly ,  and described greater marvels ,  and the monkey as he listened grew more and more gloomy . </s>  Matters were in this state when one day the shark said :   ' I really hardly know how to thank you for all your kindness to me during these weeks . </s>  Here I have nothing of my own to offer you ,  but if you would only consent to come home with me ,  how gladly would I give you anything that might happen to take your fancy . </s>  '   ' I should like nothing better ,  '  cried the monkey ,  his teeth chattering ,  as they always did when he was pleased .

Why is not your heart here ?  '  said the shark ,  with a puzzled expression . ' Oh ,  no !  Of course not . </s>  Is it possible you do not know that when we leave home we always hang up our hearts on trees ,  to prevent their being troublesome ?

' We had better turn back to the town ,  and then you can fetch it . </s>  '  Of course ,  this was just what the monkey wanted ,  but he was careful not to seem too pleased . </s>  ' Well ,  I do not know ,  '  he remarked carelessly ,   ' it is such a long way ;  but you may be right . </s>  '   ' I am sure I am ,  '  answered the shark ,   ' and I will swim as quickly as I can ,  '  and so he did ,  and in three days they caught sight of the kuyu tree hanging over the water . </s>  With a sigh of relief the monkey caught hold of the nearest branch and swung himself up . ' Wait for me here ,  '  he called out to the shark . </s>  ' I am so hungry I must have a little breakfast ,  and then I will go and look for my heart ,  '  and he went further and further into the branches so that the shark could not see him . </s>  Then he curled himself up and went to sleep . ' Are you there ?  '  cried the shark ,  who was soon tired of swimming about under the cliff ,  and was in haste to be gone . </s>  The monkey awoke with a start ,  but did not answer . ' Are you there ?  '  called the shark again ,  louder than before ,  and in a very cross voice . ' Oh ,  yes . </s>  I am here ,  '  replied the monkey ;   ' but I wish you had not wakened me up .

' I think that must be a sparrow ,  '  he said . </s>  ' Ras !  Ras !  '  but no sparrows flew out ,  for Little Lasse had no wings ,  only two small legs . </s>  ' Wait !  I will load my gun and shoot the sparrows ,  '  said the gardener . Then Little Lasse was frightened ,  and crept out on to the path . </s>  ' Forgive me ,  dear gardener !  '  he said . ' I wanted to get some fine boats . '   ' Well ,  I will this time ,  '  said the gardener . </s>  ' But another time Little Lasse must ask leave to go and look for boats in the pea bed . '   ' I will ,  '  answered Lasse ;  and he went off to the shore . </s>  Then he opened the shells with a pin ,  split them carefully in two ,  and broke small little bits of sticks for the rowers '  seats . </s>  Then he took the peas which were in the shells and put them in the boats for cargo . </s>  Some of the shells got broken ,  some remained whole ,  and when all were ready Lasse had twelve boats . But they should not be boats ,  they should be large warships . </s>  He had three liners ,  three frigates ,  three brigs and three schooners . The largest liner was called Hercules ,  and the smallest schooner The Flea . </s>  Little Lasse put all the twelve into the water ,  and they floated as splendidly and as proudly as any great ships over the waves of the ocean . </s>  And now the ships must sail round the world . </s>  The great island over there was Asia ;  that large stone Africa ;  the little island America ;  the small stones were Polynesia ;  and the shore from which the ships sailed out was Europe . </s>  The whole fleet set off and sailed far away to other parts of the world . </s>  The ships of the line steered a straight course to Asia ,  the frigates sailed to Africa ,  the brigs to America ,  and the schooners to Polynesia . </s>  But Little Lasse remained in Europe ,  and threw small stones out into the great sea . </s>  Now ,  there was on the shore of Europe a real boat ,  father ' s own ,  a beautiful white-painted boat ,  and Little Lasse got into it . </s>  Father and mother had forbidden this ,  but Little Lasse forgot . He thought he should very much like to travel to some other part of the world . </s>  ' I shall row out a little way -- only a very little way ,  '  he thought . The pea-shell boats had travelled so far that they only looked like little specks on the ocean . </s>  ' I shall seize Hercules on the coast of Asia ,  '  said Lasse ,   ' and then row home again to Europe . </s>  '  He shook the rope that held the boat ,  and ,  strange to say ,  the rope became loose . </s>  Ditsch ,  ratsch ,  a man is a man ,  and so Little Lasse manned the boat . </s>  Now he would row -- and he could row ,  for he had rowed so often on the step sat home ,  when the steps pretended to be a boat and father ' s big stick an oar . </s>  But when Little Lasse wanted to row there were no oars to be found in the boat . </s>  The oars were locked up in the boat-house ,  and Little Lasse had not noticed that the boat was empty . It is not so easy as one thinks to row to Asia without oars . </s>  What could Little Lasse do now ?  The boat was already some distance out on the sea ,  and the wind ,  which blew from land ,  was driving it still further out . </s>  Lasse was frightened and began to cry . But there was no one on the shore to hear him . </s>  Only a big crow perched alone in the birch tree ;  and the gardener ' s black cat sat under the birch tree ,  waiting to catch the crow . </s>  Neither of them troubled themselves in the least about Little Lasse ,  who was drifting out to sea . </s>  Ah !  how sorry Little Lasse was now that he had been disobedient and got into the boat ,  when father and mother had so often forbidden him to do so !  Now it was too late ,  he could not get back to land . </s>  Perhaps he would be lost out on the great sea . </s>  What should he do ?  When he had shouted until he was tired and no one heard him ,  he put his two little hands together and said ,   ' Good God ,  do not be angry with Little Lasse . </s>  '  And then he went to sleep . </s>  For although it was daylight ,  old Nukku Matti was sitting on the shores of the  ' Land of Nod ,  '  and was fishing for little children with his long fishing rod . </s>  He heard the low words which Little Lasse said to God ,  and he immediately drew the boat to himself and laid Little Lasse to sleep on a bed of rose leaves . </s>  Then Nukku Matti said to one of the Dreams ,   ' Play with Little Lasse ,  so that he does not feel lonesome . </s>  '  It was a little dream-boy ,  so little ,  so little ,  that he was less than Lasse himself ;  he had blue eyes and fair hair ,  a red cap with a silver band ,  and white coat with pearls on the collar . </s>  He came to Little Lasse and said ,   ' Would you like to sail round the world ?  '   ' Yes ,  '  said Lasse in his sleep ,   ' I should like to . </s>  '   ' Come ,  then ,  '  said the dream-boy ,   ' and let us sail in your pea-shell boats . You shall sail in Hercules and I shall sail in The Flea . </s>  '  So they sailed away from the  ' Land of Nod ,  '  and in a little while Hercules and The Flea were on the shores of Asia away at the other end of the world ,  where the Ice Sea flows through Behring Straits into the Pacific Ocean . </s>  A long way off in the winter mist they could see the explorer Nordenskiold with his ship Vega trying to find an opening between the ice . </s>  It was so cold ,  so cold ;  the great icebergs glittered strangely ,  and the huge whales now lived under the ice ,  for they could not make a hole through with their awkward heads . </s>  All around on the dreary shore there was snow and snow as far as the eye could see ;  little grey men in shaggy skins moved about ,  and drove in small sledges through the snow drifts ,  but the sledges were drawn by dogs . </s>  ' Shall we land here ?  '  asked the dream-boy . ' No ,  '  said Little Lasse . ' I am so afraid that the whales would swallow us up ,  and the big dogs bite us . </s>  Let us sail instead to another part of the world . </s>  '   ' Very well ,  '  said the dream-boy with the red cap and the silver band ;   ' it is not far to America '  -- and at the same moment they were there . </s>  The sun was shining and it was very warm . Tall palm trees grew in long rows on the shore and bore coconuts in their top branches . </s>  Men red as copper galloped over the immense green prairies and shot their arrows at the buffaloes ,  who turned against them with their sharp horns . </s>  An enormous cobra which had crept up the stem of a tall palm tree threw itself on to a little llama that was grazing at the foot . Knaps !  it was all over the little llama . </s>  ' Shall we land here ?  '  asked the dream-boy . ' No ,  '  said Little Lasse . ' I am so afraid that the buffaloes will butt us ,  and the great serpent eat us up . </s>  Let us travel to another part of the world . </s>  '   ' Very well ,  '  said the dream-boy with the white coat ,   ' it is only a little way to Polynesia '  -- and then they were there .

'   ' Your property ,  certainly ,  '  answered the son ,  and his father nodded . </s>  ' And you ?  '  asked the old man of the girl ,  who stood by her brother . ' I will have blessing ,  '  she answered ,  and her father gave her much blessing . </s>  That night he died ,  and his wife and son and daughter mourned for him seven days ,  and gave him a burial according to the custom of his people . </s>  But hardly was the time of mourning over ,  than the mother was attacked by a disease which was common in that country . </s>  ' I am going away from you ,  '  she said to her children ,  in a faint voice ;   ' but first ,  my son ,  choose which you will have :  blessing or property . </s>  '   ' Property ,  certainly ,  '  answered the son . </s>  ' And you ,  my daughter ?  '   ' I will have blessing ,  '  said the girl ;  and her mother gave her much blessing ,  and that night she died . </s>  When the days of mourning were ended ,  the brother bade his sister put outside the hut all that belonged to his father and his mother . </s>  So the girl put them out ,  and he took them away ,  save only a small pot and a vessel in which she could clean her corn . But she had no corn to clean . </s>  She sat at home ,  sad and hungry ,  when a neighbour knocked at the door . </s>  ' My pot has cracked in the fire ,  lend me yours to cook my supper in ,  and I will give you a handful of corn in return . </s>  '  And the girl was glad ,  and that night she was able to have supper herself ,  and next day another woman borrowed her pot ,  and then another and another ,  for never were known so many accidents as befell the village pots at that time . </s>  She soon grew quite fat with all the corn she earned with the help of her pot ,  and then one evening she picked up a pumpkin seed in a corner ,  and planted it near her well ,  and it sprang up ,  and gave her many pumpkins . </s>  At last it happened that a youth from her village passed through the place where the girl ' s brother was ,  and the two met and talked . </s>  ' What news is there of my sister ?  '  asked the young man ,  with whom things had gone badly ,  for he was idle . </s>  ' She is fat and well-liking ,  '  replied the youth ,   ' for the women borrow her mortar to clean their corn ,  and borrow her pot to cook it in ,  and for al this they give her more food than she can eat . </s>  '  And he went his way . </s>  Now the brother was filled with envy at the words of the man ,  and he set out at once ,  and before dawn he had reached the hut ,  and saw the pot and the mortar were standing outside . </s>  He slung them over his shoulders and departed ,  pleased with his own cleverness ;  but when his sister awoke and sought for the pot to cook her corn for breakfast ,  she could find it nowhere . </s>  At length she said to herself ,   ' Well ,  some thief must have stolen them while I slept . I will go and see if any of my pumpkins are ripe . </s>  '  And indeed they were ,  and so many that the tree was almost broken by the weight of them . </s>  So she ate what she wanted and took the others to the village ,  and gave them in exchange for corn ,  and the women said that no pumpkins were as sweet as these ,  and that she was to bring every day all that she had . </s>  In this way she earned more than she needed for herself ,  and soon was able to get another mortar and cooking pot in exchange for her corn . Then she thought she was quite rich . </s>  Unluckily someone else thought so too ,  and this was her brother ' s wife ,  who had heard all about the pumpkin tree ,  and sent her slave with a handful of grain to buy her a pumpkin . </s>  At first the girl told him that so few were left that she could not spare any ;  but when she found that he belonged to her brother ,  she changed her mind ,  and went out to the tree and gathered the largest and the ripest that was there . </s>  ' Take this one ,  '  she said to the slave ,   ' and carry it back to your mistress ,  but tell her to keep the corn ,  as the pumpkin is a gift . </s>  '  The brother ' s wife was overjoyed at the sight of the fruit ,  and when she tasted it ,  she declared it was the nicest she had ever eaten . </s>  Indeed ,  all night she thought of nothing else ,  and early in the morning she called another slave  ( for she was a rich woman )  and bade him go and ask for another pumpkin . </s>  But the girl ,  who had just been out to look at her tree ,  told him that they were all eaten ,  so he went back empty-handed to his mistress . </s>  In the evening her husband returned from hunting a long way off ,  and found his wife in tears . ' What is the matter ?  '  asked he . </s>  ' I sent a slave with some grain to your sister to buy some pumpkins ,  but she would not sell me any ,  and told me there were none ,  though I know she lets other people buy them . </s>  '   ' Well ,  never mind now -- go to sleep ,  '  said he ,   ' and to-morrow I will go and pull up the pumpkin tree ,  and that will punish her for treating you so badly . </s>  '  So before sunrise he got up and set out for his sister ' s house ,  and found her cleaning some corn . </s>  ' Why did you refuse to sell my wife a pumpkin yesterday when she wanted one ?  '  he asked . </s>  ' The old ones are finished ,  and the new ones are not yet come ,  '  answered the girl . </s>  ' When her slave arrived two days ago ,  there were only four left ;  but I gave him one ,  and would take no corn for it . </s>  '   ' I do not believe you ;  you have sold them all to other people . I shall go and cut down the pumpkin ,  '  cried her brother in a rage . </s>  ' If you cut down the pumpkin you shall cut off my hand with it ,  '  exclaimed the girl ,  running up to her tree and catching hold of it . </s>  But her brother followed ,  and with one blow cut off the pumpkin and her hand too . </s>  Then he went into the house and took away everything he could find ,  and sold the house to a friend of his who had long wished to have it ,  and his sister had no home to go to . </s>  Meanwhile she had bathed her arm carefully ,  and bound on it some healing leaves that grew near by ,  and wrapped a cloth round the leaves ,  and went to hide in the forest ,  that her brother might not find her again . </s>  For seven days she wandered about ,  eating only the fruit that hung from the trees above her ,  and every night she climbed up and tucked herself safely among the creepers which bound together the big branches ,  so that neither lions nor tigers nor panthers might get at her . </s>  When she woke up on the seventh morning she saw from her perch smoke coming up from a little town on the edge of the forest . </s>  The sight of the huts made her feel more lonely and helpless than before . </s>  She longed desperately for a draught of milk from a gourd ,  for there were no streams in that part ,  and she was very thirsty ,  but how was she to earn anything with only one hand ?  And at this thought her courage failed ,  and she began to cry bitterly .

' What a fuss over a poor little worm !  '  said the big sister scornfully . ' Yes ,  when we had cleaned the raspberries so carefully ,  '  said Lisa . </s>  ' It crept out from that very large one ,  '  put in Aina . ' And supposing someone had eaten the raspberry ,  '  said Lisa . </s>  ' Then they would have eaten the worm ,  too ,  '  said Aina . ' Well ,  what harm ?  '  said Otto . ' Eat a worm !

Who would give three straws for such a miserable little thing ?  Yes ,  but who would not like to live in such a pretty home as it lives in ;  in such a fresh fragrant dark-red cottage ,  far away in the quiet wood among flowers and green leaves !  Now it was just dinner time ,  so they all had a dinner of raspberries and cream . </s>  ' Be careful with the sugar ,  Otto ,  '  said the big sister ;  but Otto ' s plate was like a snowdrift in winter ,  with just a little red under the snow . </s>  Soon after dinner the big sister said :   ' Now we have eaten up the raspberries and we have none left to make preserve for the winter ;  it would be fine if we could get two baskets full of berries ,  then we could clean them this evening ,  and to-morrow we could cook them in the big preserving pan ,  and then we should have raspberry jam to eat on our bread !  '   ' Come ,  let us go to the wood and pick ,  '  said Lisa . </s>  ' Yes ,  let us ,  '  said Aina . ' You take the yellow basket and I will take the green one . </s>  '   ' Do not get lost ,  and come back safely in the evening ,  '  said the big sister .

It was certainly tiresome sometimes climbing over the fallen trees ,  and getting caught in the branches ,  and waging war with the juniper bushes and the midges ,  but what did that matter ?

' I am so hungry ,  '  said Lisa . </s>  ' Yes ,  '  said Aina ,   ' if we had only two good meat sandwiches now . </s>  '  As she said that ,  she felt something in her hand ,  and when she looked down ,  she saw a large sandwich of bread and chicken ,  and at the same time Lisa said :   ' How very queer !

'  The girls ,  however ,  were very hungry ,  so they ate and drank with a good appetite . </s>  When they had finished Aina yawned ,  stretched out her arms and said :   ' Oh ,  if only we had a nice soft bed to sleep on now !  '  Scarcely had she spoken before she felt a nice soft bed by her side ,  and there beside Lisa was one too . </s>  This seemed to the girls more and more wonderful ,  but tired and sleepy as they were ,  they thought no more about it ,  but crept into the little beds ,  drew the coverlets over their heads and were soon asleep . </s>  When they awoke the sun was high in the heavens ,  the wood was beautiful in the summer morning ,  and the birds were flying about in the branches and the tree tops . </s>  At first the girls were filled with wonder when they saw that they had slept in the wood among the raspberry bushes . </s>  They looked at each other ,  they looked at their beds ,  which were of the finest flax covered over with leaves and moss . </s>  At last Lisa said :   ' Are you awake ,  Aina ?  '   ' Yes ,  '  said Aina .

'   ' Denis is a good workman ,  as you know very well ,  '  answered Tephany ,  red with anger ,   ' and he puts by money too ,  and soon he will be able to take a farm for himself . </s>  '   ' Nonsense ,  '  cried Barbaik ,   ' he will never save enough for a farm till he is a hundred . </s>  I would sooner see you in your grave than the wife of a man who carries his whole fortune on his back . </s>  '   ' What does fortune matter when one is young and strong ?

'  repeated Barbaik ,  in a shocked voice . </s>  ' Is it possible that you are really so foolish as to despise money ?

'  Tephany did not dare to disobey ,  but with a heavy heart went down the path to the river . </s>  ' She is harder than these rocks ,  '  said the girl to herself ,   ' yes ,  a thousand times harder . </s>  For the rain at least can at last wear away the stone ,  but you might cry for ever ,  and she would never care . </s>  Talking to Denis is the only pleasure I have ,  and if I am not to see him I may as well enter a convent . </s>  '  Thinking these thoughts she reached the bank ,  and began to unfold the large packet of linen that had to be washed . </s>  The tap of a stick made her look up ,  and standing before her she saw a little old woman ,  whose face was strange to her . </s>  ' You would like to sit down and rest ,  granny ?  '  asked Tephany ,  pushing aside her bundle . </s>  ' When the sky is all the roof you have ,  you rest where you will ,  '  replied the old woman in trembling tones . </s>  ' Are you so lonely ,  then ?  '  inquired Tephany ,  full of pity . ' Have you no friends who would welcome you into their houses ?  '  The old woman shook her head . </s>  ' They all died long ,  long ago ,  '  she answered ,   ' and the only friends I have are strangers with kind hearts . </s>  '  The girl did not speak for a moment ,  then held out the small loaf and some bacon intended for her dinner . </s>  ' Take this ,  '  she said ;   ' to-day at any rate you shall dine well ,  '  and the old woman took it ,  gazing at Tephany the while . </s>  ' Those who help others deserve to be helped ,  '  she answered ;   ' your eyes are still red because that miser Barbaik has forbidden you to speak to the young man from Plover . </s>  But cheer up ,  you are a good girl ,  and I will give you something that will enable you to see him once every day . </s>  '   ' You ?  '  cried Tephany ,  stupefied at discovering that the beggar knew all about her affairs ,  but the old woman did not hear her . </s>  ' Take this long copper pin ,  '  she went on ,   ' and every time you stick it in your dress Mother Bourhis will be obliged to leave the house in order to go and count her cabbages . </s>  As long as the pin is in your dress you will be free ,  and your aunt will not come back until you have put it in its case again . </s>  '  Then ,  rising ,  she nodded to Tephany and vanished . The girl stood where she was ,  as still as a stone . </s>  If it had not been for the pin in her hands she would have thought she was dreaming . </s>  But by that token she knew it was no common old woman who had given it to her ,  but a fairy ,  wise in telling what would happen in the days to come . </s>  Then suddenly Tephany ' s eyes fell on the clothes ,  and to make up for lost time she began to wash them with great vigour . </s>  Next evening ,  at the moment when Denis was accustomed to wait for her in the shadow of the cowhouse ,  Tephany stuck the pin in her dress ,  and at the very same instant Barbaik took up her sabots or wooden shoes and went through the orchard and past to the fields ,  to the plot where the cabbages grew . </s>  With a heart as light as her footsteps ,  the girl ran from the house ,  and spent her evening happily with Denis . And so it was for many days after that . </s>  Then ,  at last ,  Tephany began to notice something ,  and the something made her very sad . </s>  At first ,  Denis seemed to find the hours that they were together fly as quickly as she did ,  but when he had taught her all the songs he knew ,  and told her all the plans he had made for growing rich and a great man ,  he had nothing more to say to her ,  for he ,  like a great many other people ,  was fond of talking himself ,  but not of listening to any one else . </s>  Sometimes ,  indeed ,  he never came at all ,  and the next evening he would tell Tephany that he had been forced to go into the town on business ,  but though she never reproached him she was not deceived and saw plainly that he no longer cared for her as he used to do . </s>  Day by day her heart grew heavier and her cheeks paler ,  and one evening ,  when she had waited for him in vain ,  she put her water-pot on her shoulder and went slowly down to the spring . </s>  On the path in front of her stood the fairy who had given her the pin ,  and as she glanced at Tephany she gave a little mischievous laugh and said :   ' Why ,  my pretty maiden hardly looks happier than she did before ,  in spite of meeting her lover whenever she pleases . </s>  '   ' He has grown tired of me ,  '  answered Tephany in a trembling voice ,   ' and he makes excuses to stay away . </s>  Ah !  granny dear ,  it is not enough to be able to see him ,  I must be able to amuse him and to keep him with me . He is so clever ,  you know . </s>  Help me to be clever too . '   ' Is that what you want ?  '  cried the old woman . </s>  ' Well ,  take this feather and stick it in your hair ,  and you will be as wise as Solomon himself . </s>  '  Blushing with pleasure Tephany went home and stuck the feather into the blue ribbon which girls always wear in that part of the country . </s>  In a moment she heard Denis whistling gaily ,  and as her aunt was safely counting her cabbages ,  she hurried out to meet him . The young man was struck dumb by her talk . </s>  There was nothing that she did not seem to know ,  and as for songs she not only could sing those from every part of Brittany ,  but could compose them herself .

Come in and enjoy yourself . </s>  '  And she beckoned him to follow her into a second hall whose floors and walls were formed of pearls ,  while down the sides there were tables laden with fruit and wines of all kinds ;  and as he ate and drank ,  the Groac ' h talked to him and told him how the treasures he saw came from shipwrecked vessels ,  and were brought to her palace by a magic current of water . </s>  ' I do not wonder ,  '  exclaimed Houarn ,  who now felt quite at home --  ' I do not wonder that the people on the earth have so much to say about you .

'  It was the little cow-boy driving his herd back to the byre . </s>  The farmer began to scold him furiously ,  but he answered quietly ,   ' I am going away ,  '  made his clothes into a bundle ,  said good-bye to all his friends ,  and boldly set out to seek his fortunes . </s>  There was great excitement through all the village ,  and on the top of the hill the people stood holding their sides with laughing ,  as they watched the Star Gazer trudging bravely along the valley with his bundle at the end of his stick . </s>  It was enough to make anyone laugh ,  certainly . </s>  It was well known for full twenty miles round that there lived in the castle of Beloeil twelve princesses of wonderful beauty ,  and as proud as they were beautiful ,  and who were besides so very sensitive and of such truly royal blood ,  that they would have felt at once the presence of a pea in their beds ,  even if the mattresses had been laid over it . </s>  It was whispered about that they led exactly the lives that princesses ought to lead ,  sleeping far into the morning ,  and never getting up till mid-day . </s>  They had twelve beds all in the same room ,  but what was very extraordinary was the fact that though they were locked in by triple bolts ,  every morning their satin shoes were found worn into holes . </s>  When they were asked what they had been doing all night ,  they always answered that they had been asleep ;  and ,  indeed ,  no noise was ever heard in the room ,  yet the shoes could not wear themselves out alone !  At last the Duke of Beloeil ordered the trumpet to be sounded ,  and a proclamation to be made that whoever could discover how his daughters wore out their shoes should choose one of them for his wife . </s>  On hearing the proclamation a number of princes arrived at the castle to try their luck . </s>  They watched all night behind the open door of the princesses ,  but when the morning came they had all disappeared ,  and no one could tell what had become of them . </s>  When he reached the castle ,  Michael went straight to the gardener and offered his services . </s>  Now it happened that the garden boy had just been sent away ,  and though the Star Gazer did not look very sturdy ,  the gardener agreed to take him ,  as he thought that his pretty face and golden curls would please the princesses . </s>  The first thing he was told was that when the princesses got up he was to present each one with a bouquet ,  and Michael thought that if he had nothing more unpleasant to do than that he should get on very well . </s>  Accordingly he placed himself behind the door of the princesses '  room ,  with the twelve bouquets in a basket . </s>  He gave one to each of the sisters ,  and they took them without even deigning to look at the lad ,  except Lina the youngest ,  who fixed her large black eyes as soft as velvet on him ,  and exclaimed ,   ' Oh ,  how pretty he is -- our new flower boy !  '  The rest all burst out laughing ,  and the eldest pointed out that a princess ought never to lower herself by looking at a garden boy . </s>  Now Michael knew quite well what had happened to all the princes ,  but notwithstanding ,  the beautiful eyes of the Princess Lina inspired him with a violent longing to try his fate . </s>  Unhappily he did not dare to come forward ,  being afraid that he should only be jeered at ,  or even turned away from the castle on account of his impudence . </s>  Nevertheless ,  the Star Gazer had another dream . </s>  The lady in the golden dress appeared to him once more ,  holding in one hand two young laurel trees ,  a cherry laurel and a rose laurel ,  and in the other hand a little golden rake ,  a little golden bucket ,  and a silken towel . </s>  She thus addressed him :   ' Plant these two laurels in two large pots ,  rake them over with the rake ,  water them with the bucket ,  and wipe them with the towel . </s>  When they have grown as tall as a girl of fifteen ,  say to each of them ,   '  ' My beautiful laurel ,  with the golden rake I have raked you ,  with the golden bucket I have watered you ,  with the silken towel I have wiped you . </s>  '  '  Then after that ask anything you choose ,  and the laurels will give it to you . </s>  '  Michael thanked the lady in the golden dress ,  and when he woke he found the two laurel bushes beside him . So he carefully obeyed the orders he had been given by the lady . </s>  The trees grew very fast ,  and when they were as tall as a girl of fifteen he said to the cherry laurel ,   ' My lovely cherry laurel ,  with the golden rake I have raked thee ,  with the golden bucket I have watered thee ,  with the silken towel I have wiped thee . </s>  Teach me how to become invisible . '  Then there instantly appeared on the laurel a pretty white flower ,  which Michael gathered and stuck into his button-hole . </s>  That evening ,  when the princesses went upstairs to bed ,  he followed them barefoot ,  so that he might make no noise ,  and hid himself under one of the twelve beds ,  so as not to take up much room . </s>  The princesses began at once to open their wardrobes and boxes . </s>  They took out of them the most magnificent dresses ,  which they put on before their mirrors ,  and when they had finished ,  turned themselves all round to admire their appearances . </s>  Michael could see nothing from his hiding-place ,  but he could hear everything ,  and he listened to the princesses laughing and jumping with pleasure .

But this happy state of things did not last long . </s>  Every day they grew more and more curious ,  and you will see what the end of that was . </s>  ' Sisters ,  '  said the eldest Princess ,   ' all day long we sew ,  spin ,  and read . </s>  We have been several days quite alone ,  and there is no corner of the garden that we have not explored . </s>  We have been in all the rooms of our father ' s palace ,  and have admired the rich and beautiful furniture :  why should not we go into the room that our father forbad us to enter ?

'  While they were speaking thus ,  encouraging each other ,  they had reached the room ;  the eldest fitted the key into the lock ,  and snap !  the door stood open . </s>  The three girls entered ,  and what do you think they saw ?  The room was quite empty ,  and without any ornament ,  but in the middle stood a large table ,  with a gorgeous cloth ,  and on it lay a big open book . </s>  Now the Princesses were curious to know what was written in the book ,  especially the eldest ,  and this is what she read :   ' The eldest daughter of this King will marry a prince from the East . </s>  '  Then the second girl stepped forward ,  and turning over the page she read :   ' The second daughter of this King will marry a prince from the West . </s>  '  The girls were delighted ,  and laughed and teased each other .

When did it ever happen that a king ' s daughter married a pig ?  '   ' What a baby you are !  '  said the other sister ;   ' has not our father enough soldiers to protect you ,  even if the disgusting creature did come to woo you ?  '  The youngest Princess would fain have let herself be convinced by her sisters '  words ,  and have believed what they said ,  but her heart was heavy . </s>  Her thoughts kept turning to the book ,  in which stood written that great happiness waited her sisters ,  but that a fate was in store for her such as had never before been known in the world . </s>  Besides ,  the thought weighed on her heart that she had been guilty of disobeying her father . </s>  She began to get quite ill ,  and in a few days she was so changed that it was difficult to recognise her ;  formerly she had been rosy and merry ,  now she was pale and nothing gave her any pleasure . </s>  She gave up playing with her sisters in the garden ,  ceased to gather flowers to put in her hair ,  and never sang when they sat together at their spinning and sewing . </s>  In the meantime the King won a great victory ,  and having completely defeated and driven off the enemy ,  he hurried home to his daughters ,  to whom his thoughts had constantly turned . </s>  Everyone went out to meet him with cymbals and fifes and drums ,  and there was great rejoicing over his victorious return . </s>  The King ' s first act on reaching home was to thank Heaven for the victory he had gained over the enemies who had risen against him . </s>  He then entered his palace ,  and the three Princesses stepped forward to meet him . </s>  His joy was great when he saw that they were all well ,  for the youngest did her best not to appear sad . </s>  In spite of this ,  however ,  it was not long before the King noticed that his third daughter was getting very thin and sad-looking . </s>  And all of a sudden he felt as if a hot iron were entering his soul ,  for it flashed through his mind that she had disobeyed his word . </s>  He felt sure he was right ;  but to be quite certain he called his daughters to him ,  questioned them ,  and ordered them to speak the truth . </s>  They confessed everything ,  but took good care not to say which had led the other two into temptation .

A great wedding banquet was prepared ,  and after three days of feasting the happy pair were accompanied to the frontier with much ceremony and rejoicing . </s>  After some time the same thing befell the second daughter ,  who was wooed and won by a prince from the West . </s>  Now when the young Princess saw that everything fell out exactly as had been written in the book ,  she grew very sad . </s>  She refused to eat ,  and would not put on her fine clothes nor go out walking ,  and declared that she would rather die than become a laughing-stock to the world . </s>  But the King would not allow her to do anything so wrong ,  and he comforted her in all possible ways . </s>  So the time passed ,  till lo and behold !  one fine day an enormous pig from the North walked into the palace ,  and going straight up to the King said ,   ' Hail !  oh King . </s>  May your life be as prosperous and bright as sunrise on a clear day !  '   ' I am glad to see you well ,  friend ,  '  answered the King ,   ' but what wind has brought you hither ?  '   ' I come a-wooing ,  '  replied the Pig .

And for the first time during three months the people of Hamel slept quietly through the night . </s>  The next morning ,  at nine o ' clock ,  the bagpiper repaired to the town hall ,  where the town council awaited him . </s>  ' All your rats took a jump into the river yesterday ,  '  said he to the counsellors ,   ' and I guarantee that not one of them comes back . </s>  They were nine hundred and ninety thousand ,  nine hundred and ninety-nine ,  at one gros a head .

He had crooked legs and squinting eyes ,  a large mouth all on one side ,  and a hunchback . </s>  Never was there a beautiful soul in such a frightful little body ,  but in spite of his appearance everybody loved him . </s>  The Queen ,  his mother ,  called him Curlicue ,  because it was a name she rather liked ,  and it seemed to suit him . </s>  King Grumpy ,  who cared a great deal more for his own grandeur than for his son ' s happiness ,  wished to betroth the Prince to the daughter of a neighbouring King ,  whose great estates joined his own ,  for he thought that this alliance would make him more powerful than ever ,  and as for the Princess she would do very well for Prince Curlicue ,  for she was as ugly as himself . </s>  Indeed ,  though she was the most amiable creature in the world ,  there was no concealing the fact that she was frightful ,  and so lame that she always went about with a crutch ,  and people called her Princess Cabbage-Stalk . </s>  The King ,  having asked for and received a portrait of this Princess ,  had it placed in his great hall under a canopy ,  and sent for Prince Curlicue ,  to whom he said that as this was the portrait of his future bride ,  he hoped the Prince found it charming . </s>  The Prince after one glance at it turned away with a disdainful air ,  which greatly offended his father . ' Am I to understand that you are not pleased ?  '  he said very sharply . </s>  ' No ,  sire ,  '  replied the Prince . </s>  ' How could I be pleased to marry an ugly ,  lame Princess ?  '   ' Certainly it is becoming in YOU to object to that ,  '  said King Grumpy ,   ' since you are ugly enough to frighten anyone yourself . </s>  '   ' That is the very reason ,  '  said the Prince ,   ' that I wish to marry someone who is not ugly . I am quite tired enough of seeing myself . </s>  '   ' I tell you that you shall marry her ,  '  cried King Grumpy angrily . And the Prince ,  seeing that it was of no use to remonstrate ,  bowed and retired . </s>  As King Grumpy was not used to being contradicted in anything ,  he was very much displeased with his son ,  and ordered that he should be imprisoned in the tower that was kept on purpose for rebellious Princes ,  but had not been used for about two hundred years ,  because there had not been any . </s>  The Prince thought all the rooms looked strangely old-fashioned ,  with their antique furniture ,  but as there was a good library he was pleased ,  for he was very fond of reading ,  and he soon got permission to have as many books as he liked . </s>  But when he looked at them he found that they were written in a forgotten language ,  and he could not understand a single word ,  though he amused himself with trying . </s>  King Grumpy was so convinced that Prince Curlicue would soon get tired of being in prison ,  and so consent to marry the Princess Cabbage-Stalk ,  that he sent ambassadors to her father proposing that she should come and be married to his son ,  who would make her perfectly happy . </s>  The King was delighted to receive so good an offer for his unlucky daughter ,  though ,  to tell the truth ,  he found it impossible to admire the Prince ' s portrait which had been sent to him . </s>  However ,  he had it placed in as favourable a light as possible ,  and sent for the Princess ,  but the moment she caught sight of it she looked the other way and began to cry . </s>  The King ,  who was very much annoyed to see how greatly she disliked it ,  took a mirror ,  and holding it up before the unhappy Princess ,  said :   ' I see you do not think the Prince handsome ,  but look at yourself ,  and see if you have any right to complain about that . </s>  '   ' Sire ,  '  she answered ,   ' I do not wish to complain ,  only I beg of you do not make me marry at all . </s>  I had rather be the unhappy Princess Cabbage-Stalk all my life than inflict the sight of my ugliness on anyone else . </s>  '  But the King would not listen to her ,  and sent her away with the ambassadors . </s>  In the meantime the Prince was kept safely locked up in his tower ,  and ,  that he might be as dull as possible ,  King Grumpy ordered that no one should speak to him ,  and that they should give him next to nothing to eat . </s>  But all the Princess guards were so fond of him that they did everything they dared ,  in spite of the King ,  to make the time pass pleasantly . </s>  One day ,  as the Prince was walking up and down the great gallery ,  thinking how miserable it was to be so ugly ,  and to be forced to marry an equally frightful Princess ,  he looked up suddenly and noticed that the painted windows were particularly bright and beautiful ,  and for the sake of doing something that would change his sad thoughts he began to examine them attentively . </s>  He found that the pictures seemed to be scenes from the life of a man who appeared in every window ,  and the Prince ,  fancying that he saw in this man some resemblance to himself ,  began to be deeply interested . </s>  In the first window there was a picture of him in one of the turrets of the tower ,  farther on he was seeking something in a chink in the wall ,  in the next picture he was opening an old cabinet with a golden key ,  and so it went on through numbers of scenes ,  and presently the Prince noticed that another figure occupied the most important place in each scene ,  and this time it was a tall handsome young man :  poor Prince Curlicue found it a pleasure to look at him ,  he was so straight and strong . </s>  By this time it had grown dark ,  and the Prince had to go back to his own room ,  and to amuse himself he took up a quaint old book and began to look at the pictures . </s>  But his surprise was great to find that they represented the same scenes as the windows of the gallery ,  and what was more ,  that they seemed to be alive . </s>  In looking at pictures of musicians he saw their hands move and heard sweet sounds ;  there was a picture of a ball ,  and the Prince could watch the little dancing people come and go . </s>  He turned a page ,  and there was an excellent smell of a savoury dinner ,  and one of the figures who sat at the feast looked at him and said :   ' We drink your health ,  Curlicue . </s>  Try to give us our Queen again ,  for if you do you will be rewarded ;  if not ,  it will be the worse for you . </s>  '  At these words the Prince ,  who had been growing more and more astonished ,  was fairly terrified ,  and dropping the book with a crash he sank back insensible . </s>  The noise he made brought his guards to his aid ,  and as soon as he revived they asked him what was the matter . </s>  He answered that he was so faint and giddy with hunger that he had imagined he saw and heard all sorts of strange things . </s>  Thereupon ,  in spite of the King ' s orders ,  the guards gave him an excellent supper ,  and when he had eaten it he again opened his book ,  but could see none of the wonderful pictures ,  which convinced him that he must have been dreaming before . </s>  However ,  when he went into he gallery next day and looked at the painted windows again ,  he found that they moved ,  and the figures came and went as if they had been alive ,  and after watching the one who was like himself find the key in the crack of the turret wall and open the old cabinet ,  he determined to go and examine the place himself ,  and try to find out what the mystery was .

'   ' Now Heaven help us ,  '  replied her stepdaughter ;   ' strawberries do not grow in winter ;  the earth is all frozen and the snow has covered up everything ;  and why send me in a paper dress ?  it is so cold outside that one ' s very breath freezes ;  the wind will whistle through my dress ,  and the brambles tear it from my body . </s>  '   ' How dare you contradict me !

'  he asked her . ' Renelde ,  my lord . </s>  '   ' You must get tired of staying in such a lonely place ?  '   ' I am accustomed to it ,  my lord ,  and I never get tired of it . </s>  '   ' That may be so ;  but come to the castle ,  and I will make you lady ' s maid to the Countess . '   ' I cannot do that ,  my lord . </s>  I have to look after my grandmother ,  who is very helpless . '   ' Come to the castle ,  I tell you . I shall expect you this evening ,  '  and he went on his way . </s>  But Renelde ,  who was betrothed to a young wood-cutter called Guilbert ,  had no intention of obeying the Count ,  and she had ,  besides ,  to take care of her grandmother . </s>  Three days later the Count again passed by . ' Why did not you come ?  '  he asked the pretty spinner . ' I told you ,  my lord ,  that I have to look after my grandmother . </s>  '   ' Come to-morrow ,  and I will make you lady-in-waiting to the Countess ,  '  and he went on his way . </s>  This offer produced no more effect than the other ,  and Renelde did not go to the castle . </s>  ' If you will only come ,  '  said the Count to her when next he rode by ,   ' I will send away the Countess ,  and will marry you . </s>  '  But two years before ,  when Renelde ' s mother was dying of a long illness ,  the Countess had not forgotten them ,  but had given help when they sorely needed it . </s>  So even if the Count had really wished to marry Renelde ,  she would always have refused . Some weeks passed before Burchard appeared again . </s>  Renelde hoped she had got rid of him ,  when one day he stopped at the door ,  his duck-gun under his arm and his game-bag on his shoulder . </s>  This time Renelde was spinning not hemp ,  but flax . ' What are you spinning ?  '  he asked in a rough voice . ' My wedding shift ,  my lord . </s>  '   ' You are going to be married ,  then ?  '   ' Yes ,  my lord ,  by your leave . '  For at that time no peasant could marry without the leave of his master . </s>  ' I will give you leave on one condition . Do you see those tall nettles that grow on the tombs in the churchyard ?  Go and gather them ,  and spin them into two fine shifts . </s>  One shall be your bridal shift ,  and the other shall be my shroud . For you shall be married the day that I am laid in my grave . </s>  '  And the Count turned away with a mocking laugh . Renelde trembled . Never in all Locquignol had such a thing been heard of as the spinning of nettles . </s>  And besides ,  the Count seemed made of iron and was very proud of his strength ,  often boasting that he should live to be a hundred . </s>  Every evening ,  when his work was done ,  Guilbert came to visit his future bride . This evening he came as usual ,  and Renelde told him what Burchard had said . </s>  ' Would you like me to watch for the Wolf ,  and split his skull with a blow from my axe ?  '   ' No ,  '  replied Renelde ,   ' there must be no blood on my bridal bouquet . </s>  And then we must not hurt the Count . Remember how good the Countess was to my mother . </s>  '  An old ,  old woman now spoke :  she was the mother of Renelde ' s grandmother ,  and was more than ninety years old . </s>  All day long she sat in her chair nodding her head and never saying a word . </s>  ' My children ,  '  she said ,   ' all the years that I have lived in the world ,  I have never heard of a shift spun from nettles . </s>  But what God commands ,  man can do . </s>  Why should not Renelde try it ?  '  Renelde did try ,  and to her great surprise the nettles when crushed and prepared gave a good thread ,  soft and light and firm . </s>  Very soon she had spun the first shift ,  which was for her own wedding . She wove and cut it out at once ,  hoping that the Count would not force her to begin the other . </s>  Just as she had finished sewing it ,  Burchard the Wolf passed by . </s>  ' Well ,  '  said he ,   ' how are the shifts getting on ?  '   ' Here ,  my lord ,  is my wedding garment ,  '  answered Renelde ,  showing him the shift ,  which was the finest and whitest ever seen . </s>  The Count grew pale ,  but he replied roughly ,   ' Very good . Now begin the other . '  The spinner set to work . </s>  As the Count returned to the castle ,  a cold shiver passed over him ,  and he felt ,  as the saying is ,  that some one was walking over his grave . </s>  He tried to eat his supper ,  but could not ;  he went to bed shaking with fever . But he did not sleep ,  and in the morning could not manage to rise . </s>  This sudden illness ,  which every instant became worse ,  made him very uneasy . No doubt Renelde ' s spinning-wheel knew all about it . </s>  Was it not necessary that his body ,  as well as his shroud ,  should be ready for the burial ?  The first thing Burchard did was to send to Renelde and to stop her wheel . </s>  Renelde obeyed ,  and that evening Guilbert asked her :   ' Has the Count given his consent to our marriage ?  '   ' No ,  '  said Renelde . ' Continue your work ,  sweetheart . </s>  It is the only way of gaining it . You know he told you so himself . </s>  '  The following morning ,  as soon as she had put the house in order ,  the girl sat down to spin . </s>  Two hours after there arrived some soldiers ,  and when they saw her spinning they seized her ,  tied her arms and legs ,  and carried her to the bank of the river ,  which was swollen by the late rains . </s>  When they reached the bank they flung her in ,  and watched her sink ,  after which they left her . </s>  But Renelde rose to the surface ,  and though she could not swim she struggled to land . Directly she got home she sat down and began to spin . </s>  Again came the two soldiers to the cottage and seized the girl ,  carried her to the river bank ,  tied a stone to her neck and flung her into the water . </s>  The moment their backs were turned the stone untied itself . Renelde waded the ford ,  returned to the hut ,  and sat down to spin . </s>  This time the Count resolved to go to Locquignol himself ;  but ,  as he was very weak and unable to walk ,  he had himself borne in a litter . And still the spinner spun . </s>  When he saw her he fired a shot at her ,  as he would have fired at a wild beast . The bullet rebounded without harming the spinner ,  who still spun on . </s>  Burchard fell into such a violent rage that it nearly killed him . He broke the wheel into a thousand pieces ,  and then fell fainting on the ground . </s>  He was carried back to the castle ,  unconscious . The next day the wheel was mended ,  and the spinner sat down to spin . </s>  Feeling that while she was spinning he was dying ,  the Count ordered that her hands should be tied ,  and that they should not lose sight of her for one instant . </s>  But the guards fell asleep ,  the bonds loosed themselves ,  and the spinner spun on .

'  The princess jumped out of bed screaming ,   ' The lion !  the lion !  '  but her friends thought it was a nightmare ,  and did not trouble themselves to get up . </s>  ' O lovely uprincess !  '  continued the voice ,   ' fear nothing !  I am the son of a rich merchant ,  and desire above all things to have you for my wife . </s>  And in order to get to you I have hidden myself in this golden lion . '   ' What use is that ?  '  she asked . </s>  ' For if you cannot pick me out from among my companions you will still lose your head . '   ' I look to you to help me ,  '  he said . </s>  ' I have done so much for you that you might do this one thing for me . '   ' Then listen to me . </s>  On the eighth day I will tie a white sash round my waist ,  and by that you will know me . </s>  '  The next morning the king came very early to fetch the lion ,  as the old woman was already at the palace asking for it . </s>  When they were safe from view she let the young man out ,  and he returned to the king and told him that he wished to find the princess . </s>  ' Very good ,  '  said the king ,  who by this time was almost tired of repeating the same words ;   ' but if you fail your head will be the forfeit . </s>  '  So the youth remained quietly in the castle ,  eating and looking at all the beautiful things around him ,  and every now and then pretending to be searching busily in all the closets and corners . </s>  On the eighth day he entered the room where the king was sitting .

Such a splendid embassy had never before been seen in any country . </s>  The kingdom was left in the charge of the Prime Minister ,  who answered  ' Ditto '  to everything ;  but the choice was better than it seemed ,  for the worthy man was much beloved by the people ,  as he agreed with all they said ,  and they left him feeling very pleased with themselves and their own wisdom . </s>  When the king arrived at Diaphana ' s Court he found a magnificent reception awaiting him ,  for ,  though they pretended not to know who he was ,  secrets like this are never hidden . </s>  Now the young king had a great dislike to long ceremonies ,  so he proposed that his second interview with the princess should take place in the garden . </s>  The princess made some difficulties ,  but ,  as the weather was lovely and very still ,  she at last consented to the king ' s wishes . </s>  But no sooner had they finished their first bows and curtseys than a slight breeze sprung up ,  and began to sway the princess ,  whose equerries had retired out of respect . </s>  The king went forward to steady her ,  but the wind that he caused only drove her further away from him . </s>  He rushed after her exclaiming ,   ' O princess !  are you really running away from me ?  '   ' Good gracious ,  no !  '  she replied . </s>  ' Run a little quicker and you will be able to stop me ,  and I shall be for ever grateful . </s>  That is what comes of talking in a garden ,  '  she added in disgust ;   ' as if one was not much better in a room that was tightly closed all round . </s>  '  The king ran as fast as he could ,  but the wind ran faster still ,  and in a moment the princess was whirled to the bottom of the garden ,  which was bounded by a ditch . </s>  She cleared it like a bird ,  and the king ,  who was obliged to stop short at the edge ,  saw the lovely Diaphana flying over the plain ,  sometimes driven to the right ,  sometimes to the left ,  till at last she vanished out of sight . </s>  By this time the whole court were running over the plain ,  some on foot and some on horseback ,  all hurrying to the help of their princess ,  who really was in some danger ,  for the wind was rising to the force of a gale . </s>  The king looked on for a little ,  and then returned with his attendants to the palace ,  reflecting all the while on the extreme lightness of his proposed bride and the absurdity of having a wife that rose in the air better than any kite . </s>  He thought on the whole that it would be wiser not to wait longer ,  but to depart at once ,  and he started on horseback at the very moment when the princess had been found by her followers ,  wet to the skin ,  and blown against a rick . </s>  Souci met the carriage which was bringing her home ,  and stopped to congratulate her on her escape ,  and to advise her to put on dry clothes . Then he continued his journey . </s>  It took a good while for the king to get home again ,  and he was rather cross at having had so much trouble for nothing . </s>  Besides which ,  his courtiers made fun at his adventure ,  and he did not like being laughed at ,  though of course they did not dare to do it before his face . </s>  And the end of it was that very soon he started on his travels again ,  only allowing one equerry to accompany him ,  and even this attendant he managed to lose the moment he had left his own kingdom behind him . </s>  Now it was the custom in those days for princes and princesses to be brought up by fairies ,  who loved them as their own children ,  and did not mind what inconvenience they put other people to for their sakes ,  for all the world as if they had been real mothers . </s>  The fairy Aveline ,  who lived in a country that touched at one point the kingdom of King Souci ,  had under her care the lovely Princess Minon-Minette ,  and had made up her mind to marry her to the young king ,  who ,  in spite of his awkward manners ,  which could be improved ,  was really very much nicer than most of the young men she was likely to meet . </s>  So Aveline made her preparations accordingly ,  and began by arranging that the equerry should lose himself in the forest ,  after which she took away the king ' s sword and his horse while he lay asleep under a tree . </s>  Her reason for this was that she felt persuaded that ,  finding himself suddenly alone and robbed of everything ,  the king would hide his real birth ,  and would have to fall back on his powers of pleasing ,  like other men ,  which would be much better for him . </s>  When the king awoke and found that the tree to which he had tied his horse had its lowest branch broken ,  and that nothing living was in sight ,  he was much dismayed ,  and sought high and low for his lost treasure ,  but all in vain .
